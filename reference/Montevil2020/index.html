The underlying conception is that the historicity of biological objects would not matter to understand a situation here and now, or, at least, historicity would not impact the method of modeling. We analyze that it is not the case with concrete examples. Historicity forces a conceptual reconfiguration where equations no longer play a central role. We argue that all observations depend on objects defined by their historical origin instead of their relations as in physics. Therefore, we propose that biological variations and historicity come first, and regularities are constraints with limited validity in biology. Their proper theoretical and empirical use requires specific rationales.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>A classical perspective to articulate historical and anhistorical reasoning stems from linguistic. — (Montévil, 2020, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark><em><strong>deux sous-disciplines viennent de là.</strong></em></mark> Along the same line, in an influential article, Mayr (1961) distinguishes functional biology and evolutionary biology. — (Montévil, 2020, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark><em><strong>Genes are important traces of the past.

Symmetrization may be more or less strong; for example, one can study the metabolism or mammals or study the metabolism of a clonal population of cells. However, it is never possible to consider that a symmetrization would be perfect; variations are always possible. Moreover, stronger symmetrizations are not always better.
