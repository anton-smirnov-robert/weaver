(2015)<br><em>Journal of Theoretical Biology</em> 372: 179-191<br>DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.02.029</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We propose a conceptual and formal characterisation of biological organisation as a closure of constraints. We ﬁrst establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in nonequilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>our central thesis is that organisational closure should be understood as closure of constraints,aregimeof causation which is at the same time distinct from - and related to - the underlying causal regime of thermodynamic openness — (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In contrast to fundamental physical equations and their underlying symmetries, constraints are contingent causes5,exertedbyspecifi — (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>structures or dynamics, which reduce the degrees of freedom of the system on which they act.
