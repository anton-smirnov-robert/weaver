(2014)<br><em>Synthese</em> 194: 1089-1114<br>DOI: 10.1007/s11229-014-0594-z</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper argues that biological organisation can be legitimately conceived of as an intrinsically teleological causal regime. The core of the argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination: biological organisation determines itself in the sense that the effects of its activity contribute to determine its own conditions of existence. We suggest that not any kind of circular regime realises self-determination, which should be speciﬁcally understood as self-constraint: in biological systems, in particular, selfconstraint takes the form of closure, i.e. a network of mutually dependent constitutive constraints. We then explore the occurrence of intrinsic teleology in the biological domain and beyond. On the one hand, the organisational account might possibly concede that supra-organismal biological systems (as symbioses or ecosystems) could realise closure, and hence be teleological. On the other hand, the realisation of closure beyond the biological realm appears to be highly unlikely. In turn, the occurrence of simpler forms of self-determination remains a controversial issue, in particular with respect to the case of self-organising dissipative systems.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the organisation of biological systems is inherently teleological, which means that its own activity is, in a fundamental sense, first and foremost oriented toward an end. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The core of our argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the teleology is extrinsic for the case of artefacts, and intrinsic for the case of biological systems (Jonas 1966) — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>self-determination grounds teleology because it takes the specific form of self-constraint — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>constraints subject to closure correspond to biological functions. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>if circular causation does not occur as self-constraint, it amounts instead to a chain of transformations in which the system as a whole plays no role in specifying its own dynamics, and these dynamics are sufficiently determined by the external boundary conditions. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>self-constraint implies that the circular organisation specifies its own dynamics: that is why only self-constraint involves selfdetermination, and why biological organisation (by realising closure) is teleological. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>since the nineteenth century teleology has been replaced by other principles (geodesics, Le Chatelier’s, second law of thermodynamics, attractors&mldr;),1 that account for the tendency of physical systems to reach certain stable “goal states”, even under perturbations, without appealing to an inversion of the temporal relation between causes and effects. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection (Darwin 1859), and Bernard’s notion of conservation of the internal milieu (Bernard 1865).

In particular, the existence of current traits is the consequence of the selection exerted on the effects produced by previous occurrences of the trait. In such a way, selection allows us to consider organisms as designed, and their history as teleological, insofar as the existence of a type of trait can be explained by some of its specific effects or consequences, that have contributed to the adaptation and survival of the organism to which the trait belongs. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 5)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the evolutionary account actually presupposes the existence of individual organisms that are able to survive and reproduce in their environment.

The underlying theoretical framework is that of (mainly French) molecular biology, centred on the notion of program (Jacob and Monod 1961; Mayr 1961; Jacob 1970; Monod 1970). In this line of thought, the concept of genetic program, in the context of Darwinian evolution, rehabilitates teleology (Jacob 1970,p.9)as an admissible scientific dimension. The central idea is that teleological behaviours, which control the form, as well as the adaptivity of biological organisms, are subtended by genetic molecular mechanisms.9 In turn, these mechanisms, by enabling the reproduction of the organism, determine the conditions of its own persistence. In this perspective, therefore, the goal is not extrinsic, but rather intrinsic to the system, since it is specified by a program that determines its future states. The program, in turn, has been specified by evolution (Jacob 1970,p.8) — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 8)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In doing so, Piaget elaborates the crucial theoretical concept of organisational closure, which he considers as complementary to that of thermodynamic openness, already emphasised by von Bertalanffy (1949) — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 10)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>According to them, autopoietic systems are systems without goals. The main target of their criticism of teleology is twofold: on the one hand, the reductive focus of the genetic approach on a specific subsystem (the genome as a program) as the only one responsible for self-determination; on the other hand, the temporal scale of the evolutionary approach, which has no explanatory significance in analysing individual organisms. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In our view, Maturana & Varela’s position is inadequate, because it fails to recognise that it is possible to provide a distinct account of biological teleology by relying on the notion of organisational closure. Discarding teleology in toto, indeed, may lead to obscuring the qualitative differences which exist between biological systems and any other kind of natural or artificial systems. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>At first sight, closure seems to be an adequate tool to grasp the difference with both artefacts and other categories of natural systems: indeed, intuition seems to confirm that it is only in the biological case that the parts exist only insofar as the system does. The parts of a rock do not dissolve if the whole is broken, just as the components of a computer do not disintegrate if the whole machine is disassembled. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 12)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Rosen naturalises teleology by abstracting closure from time, and by considering a purely relational description of the circular causal regime, and not a dynamical one, based on temporal sequences of states. All subsequent accounts of closure share, we hold, the very same strategy for naturalisation. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 14)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Based on Atkins’ ideas about work, conceived of as a constrained release of energy (Atkins 1984) — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>What are constraints? They can be conceived as local and contingent causes, which reduce the degrees of freedom of the dynamics on which they act (Pattee 1973), while remaining conserved (at the time scale which is relevant to describe their causal action) with respect to those dynamics. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>we argue that cycles of transformations can be adequately described in terms of far from equilibrium circular dynamics, whose conditions of existence are sufficiently determined by independent boundary conditions. — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 18)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>dissipative structures and closed organisations would have almost nothing in common with respect to their causal regimes, except for the very fact of being both intrinsically teleological — (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 22)</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.c2737d3ec1f70c1ec909ea32322fcfe8.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li><li><a href=/About-me>About me</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
