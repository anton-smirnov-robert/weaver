For example, phylogenetic trees minimize the number of novelty appearances to maximize the coherency of the classification. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In mathematics, the structure of logical proofs is hypothetic-deductive, meaning that there should be nothing genuinely new in the proof after the hypotheses have been formulated. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>we aim to provide a framework to respond to typical objections by mathematicians and physicists. These objections correspond to the following line of reasoning. We can always define spaces that are large enough to seemingly accommodate every possibility so that there is no need for the concept of new possibility and the concept of possibility is sufficient. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Bergson discusses the case of symphonies and states that a symphony is not possible before it becomes real because conceiving the precise possibility of a symphony is equivalent to composing it. However, we point out that one can define the set of all possible music scores as the set of combinations of musical symbols. We show that the confrontation of these two lines of reasoning leads to a paradox. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The paradox is that it is possible to define a set which includes all written symphonies, thus arguably all possible symphonies — (Montévil, 2019, p. 5)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Can we define the possibility of a symphony without composing it? — (Montévil, 2019, p. 5)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Bergson’s reasoning has no obvious flaw: having a precise and complete idea of the possibility of a symphony implies that this symphony has already been composed. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Another way to emphasize this point is to say that there are more real numbers that possible names to name them individually, which makes most individual real numbers ineffable — (Montévil, 2019, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The lack of specific definitions for each real numbers does not prevent mathematical reasoning on them. Instead of reasoning on specific numbers, in most cases, reasoning involves generic properties where numbers appear as generic variables. For example, the statement x2 ≥ 0 is valid for any real number x and this statement is about a generic x. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Since only finite proofs are possible, it is only possible to handle a finite number of specific cases. As a result, reasoning on infinite sets requires generic statements. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>From the viewpoint of mathematical logic, we thus have three different situations for the definition of individual properties: – The set is defined, but not all of its elements can be defined individually within any axiomatic, like in the case of the real numbers. – The set is defined, and all individual elements can be defined in principle. However, any actual discussion can only involve a subset of individual elements because the set is infinite. A paradigmatic example is the set of natural numbers. – The set is finite, and there is no principled limitation. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 7)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Ms is comparable to natural numbers and all individual music score can be defined by a finite axiomatic, even though only a few of them can be defined in any discussion. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 7)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Here, “symphony” means loosely a musical piece that a music lover enjoys — (Montévil, 2019, p. 7)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In physics, it is usual for relevant — (Montévil, 2019, p. 7)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>properties to be generic. For example, the force exerted on an object A in free fall is m−g → where −g → is the gravity field, and m is the mass of A. The analysis of free fall does not depend on the individual values of m—being real numbers most individual masses are ineffable—or on the nature of the object. Instead all possible m lead to the same analysis of trajectories. The genericity of the analysis is possible because physics is not about quantities. Instead, physics is based on (generic) relations between quantities. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>mathematics can treat a finite number of individual cases and an infinite number of generic cases. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In some situations, there is a finite number of bifurcations, and a discussion of every individual case is possible. In other situations, the number of bifurcations is infinite, but their process is generic which makes an exhaustive analysis possible. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>To discuss the situation, they analyze the generic process of period doubling when r becomes close to rc, and this leads to relevant predictions (Feigenbaum 1980). The situation is analogous to the analysis of fractals: fractals look heterogeneous with qualitative patterns at all scales, but all scales are symmetric and a generic analysis is then possible. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Sets of possibilities with probability 0 are considered irrelevant, they are not forbidden but never happen in practice and thus do not play a theoretical role. As a result, discussing their specific properties is not required. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In statistical mechanics, all microscopic states are possible. These possibility spaces include all kinds of patterns that are remarkable for a human observer. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In general, physical models and theories restrict the discussion to generic properties and do not have to examine the specific properties that some individual microscopic states display. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>By contrast, we think that the relevant properties of symphonies are not generic or at least they are not generic properties of the set Ms of music scores. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>There are attempts to consider generic properties of a given musical style (usually the style of a specific author or interpret) and then to generate new music scores or soundtracks verifying these generic properties (Pachet and Roy 2014; Papadopoulos et al. 2016). These attempts use machine learning in combination with a few generic criteria that musical patterns are assumed to follow. The aim is to obtain a generic generator of acceptable soundtracks and thus to define and explore sets that have generic regularities that are assumed to be musically relevant. However, these generic regularities are not written in the algorithm, and they are not pre-stated (except for the generic criteria mentioned above). Instead, they are extracted by machine learning. Thus, the individual works of the musician rigorously preexist the definition of the generic properties extracted from machine learning and not the other way around. It follows that these generic sets are specific to the past of an individual composer or style and are subordinated to it. Moreover, assuming that there can be genuine qualitative novelties that result from probing these sets, there is no guaranty that they would be musically interesting. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In physics (and epistemologically similar modeling approaches), the relevant properties are usually generic properties. Physicists understand systems whose states are in enormous sets thanks to these generic properties and not by the specific properties of the individual possibilities (the elements of these sets). In the case of music, the set of possible music scores differs from the set of possible symphonies. For “the musician [to have] a precise and complete idea of the symphony”, she needs at least to consider a possible music score as a possible symphony. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>A fair generic description of acceptable symphonies would require a generic understanding of how symphonies work in the sense of having a musical meaning where the various possibilities would be understood collectively. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>First, musical meaning is not an intrinsic property of a sequence of musical signs. Instead, musical meaning takes place in a historical, cultural context. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Chaotic dynamical systems may have rich dynamics, but, in a precise sense, they are not creating something new. Mathematically, the richness of their patterns stems from the fact that they are digging deeper and deeper into their initial conditions. Their analysis focuses on the way in which the dynamics are transforming the initial conditions, not the specific pattern stemming from a given initial condition. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 10)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>It is not a generic property of the dynamics un to generate a meaningful text. The mathematical analysis of the generic properties of un does not involve the meaning of Bergson’s text. In other terms, the odds to find initial conditions of un that generate Bergson’s text are almost null. It is necessary to have written this text beforehand to choose initial conditions leading un to generate it. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 10)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>we advocate a theoretical notion of possibilities, which we also call explicit possibilities, where possibilities are defined if and only if we define explicitly also how they “work”, that is to say how they take place in an appropriate theoretical framework where they have meaning. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The set of possible music scores has generic properties that are relevant for writing, writing software or printing. These operations are its natural theoretical context. Music scores are used to communicate symphonies as a writing system, which means that they are typically sufficient for constraining the receiver for her to interpret some music scores as symphonies. However, the theoretical construct used to define Ms is not sufficient for a sound theoretical understanding of symphonies themselves. This limitation is not just due to Ms lacking generic constructs. Instead, the meaning of musical possibilities lies at the individual level which means that musical sense is not a generic property. Thus, Ms may only be seen as a set of pre-possibilities for symphonies and not as a set of explicit possibilities. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>We call “pre-possibilities” sets whose meaning is not entirely explicit for the intended phenomena. Pre-possibilities are usually possibilities defined in an initial theoretical context6 that are used in another context where they do not meet the criteria of explicit possibilities. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Elements of a set may have the status of pre-possibility for epistemic or objective reasons. Epistemic reasons correspond to a lack of knowledge, typically when the generic definition of pre-possibilities can be completed with other generic constructs that endow them with a satisfying theoretical structure for the intended phenomena. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>When specific properties of individual elements are what matters, then we cannot transform a generic set of pre-possibilities into explicit possibilities. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the notations do not define musical possibilities and composing symphonies is not an exploration of the space of music scores. Instead, musical notations enabled the practice of classical music and reciprocally are determined by the historical changes in the practice of music. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 12)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>let us consider complete genetic determinism, that is to say, the assumption that dna sequences entirely determine phenotypes. This viewpoint is no longer dominant since the roles of the environment (Gilbert and Epel 2009) and of random factors (Paldi 2003; Heams 2014; Montévil et al. 2016) are increasingly becoming acknowledged. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 13)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The relation between individual sequences and protein shapes has a complex structure (Stadler et al. 2001) — (Montévil, 2019, p. 13)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The functioning of organisms is not a generic property that can be discussed on the basis of the possible dna sequences alone; it includes specificities proper to different phyla and even proper to some individuals — (Montévil, 2019, p. 14)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the notion of new possibilities and diachronic emergence — (Montévil, 2019, p. 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Determinism follows from the application of the Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem which ensures that this kind of dynamical system has a unique solution for a given state at a time t0. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the sets involved have the same cardinality as real numbers, and this cardinality implies that we cannot define individually all their elements — (Montévil, 2019, p. 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In this deterministic frame, all contingent events come down to specific properties of initial conditions. Therefore, all arguments which state that such events are decisive for biological phenomena (for example, Beatty 1995; Gould 2002; Montévil et al. 2016) can be translated into arguments to state that biology depends on specific properties of these initial conditions. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>these phenomena are spontaneous and may be repeated ad libidum. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 16)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>There is randomness in these phenomena but this randomness only corresponds to the way in which the symmetry is broken, or in other words the “choice” of one direction or another. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 16)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>equations do not change during the formation of new structures, at least at the microscopic level. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 16)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>once a parameter reaches a value given by the equations, the novelty has to appear. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 17)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>We propose then to distinguish virtual possibilities from actual possibilities. Virtual possibilities do not follow from the causal relations required to understand the initial situation. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 17)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>actual possibilities are possibilities which may be qualitatively different but are nevertheless entailed by the relations between the parts of a system before the possibility becomes actualized. In physical models, the novelty is not just virtual in the initial situation; its formal ingredients are already there. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 17)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the punctual nature of the appearance of these new structures corresponds to their elementary nature and contributes to explaining why such changes occur spontaneously — (Montévil, 2019, p. 17)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the set of qualitatively different macroscopic patterns is usually very small. The examples in the beginning of this discussion lead to a finite and actually a small number of such possibilities which means that they can all be predicted, provided that the equations describing them remain valid. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 17)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>these systems are mostly ahistorical, and this is crucial for the concept of novelty. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 17)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The transformation from liquid to ice is the same independently of whether the past of the system includes this state or not. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 18)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>We think that the proper understanding of organisms or species has to include the many functions that contribute to their organization, survival, and reproduction. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 18)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In biology, we then posit that historicity stems from the coupling between specificity and functionality. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 19)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>In both accounts, the relationships between the part studied and a larger whole are fundamental, and this applies to biological novelties inasmuch as we assume that they are functional. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 20)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>By definition of an organization, a relevant novelty (i) contributes to the maintaining of at least another constraint of the organization and (ii) is maintained by processes which are canalized by at least another constraint of the organization. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 20)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The relations leading to (i) and (ii) do not necessarily appear simultaneously. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 20)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The constraint plays a role and this role is performed in a specific manner by generating other constraints. However, this is not sufficient, and it is also necessary to make explicit its dependence on other constraints. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 20)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The point is that the theoretical description of functions is no longer elementary in relational accounts such as closure of constraints. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 20)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>A part may be involved in the appearance of other new possibilities, and this form of causation has been called enablement — (Montévil, 2019, p. 22)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Then, a novelty may become deeply integrated into certain biological organizations, making its complete disappearance unlikely to be viable. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 22)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>biological novelties are not elementary events. Instead, they involve the integration to an organization, a life cycle and an environment and this integration typically involves a sequence of changes. It justifies that biological novelties are specific even when some aspects of them are generic. As a result, biological changes involve non-generic changes, and we think that the concept of new possibilities is fundamental for biology. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 22)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>it is not sufficient for a dynamics to be able to generate a pattern of interest for this dynamics to actually explain this pattern, that is to say for this pattern to be an explicit possibility of this system. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 22)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Now, a further counter-argument would be to change the definition of S a posteriori so that the new possibility a becomes generic. This objection requires a precise discussion. Let us call S(t) the possibility space at time t. If the observer witnesses a new possibility at time t′ > t, then the possibility space S(t′) is larger than S(t). The operation that we have described in the previous paragraph is retrospectively to consider St′ (t), the space of possibility at time t on the basis of a novelty that appeared between t and t′. Bergson calls conflating St′ (t) and S(t) the retrospective illusion. This illusion may be compared with the situation in usual probabilities. Using the result of a random drawing to describe the initial condition makes it always possible to describe the process as deterministic which is clearly wrong at this level of description. The novelty used to define St′ (t) by comparison with S(t) does not come from the actual behavior at t or before, ex hypothesi. The cost of conflating St′(t) and S(t) is that the definition of St depends on ulterior phenomena and becomes a finalist description: this methodology has a bias towards a specific outcome by excluding many alternative changes which are not taken into account. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 23)</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.c2737d3ec1f70c1ec909ea32322fcfe8.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li><li><a href=/About-me>About me</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
