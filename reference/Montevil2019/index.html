(2019)<br><em>Biology & Philosophy</em> 34: 35<br>DOI: 10.1007/s10539-019-9687-x</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We characterize access to empirical objects in biology from a theoretical perspective. Unlike objects in current physical theories, biological objects are the result of a history and their variations continue to generate a history. This property is the starting point of our concept of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is relative to a natural history which is shared by the different objects subjected to the measurement and is more or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to considering biological objects as equivalent in a measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by studying objects as similar as possible, while others build on biological diversity.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p><mark><em><strong>again physic-like trends</strong></em></mark> Biologists often use physical concepts, and measurement is no exception. — (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>A classical measurement has a limited precision, but knowing finite, discrete structures with a sufficient finite precision means knowing them exactly — (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p><mark><em><strong>So commensurability and abstract constructs (such as space-time)</strong></em></mark> These assumptions ensure that the measurement has a meaning — (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p><mark><em><strong>Where does the principle of variation come from ?</strong></em></mark> This idea has been developed theoretically and called the principle of variation (Montévil et al., 2016).
