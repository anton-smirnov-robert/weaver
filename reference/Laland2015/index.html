(2015)<br><em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</em> 282: 20151019<br>DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2015.1019</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis&rsquo; (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The Modern Synthesis (MS) emerged in the first half of the twentieth century, with the integration of Darwinian natural selection, population-level thinking and Mendelian inheritance — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 1)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>today’s evolutionary theory is vastly more sophisticated than the original synthesis and covers a broader range of phenomena. However, while such progress is undeniable, it does not imply that the underlying conceptual framework allows evolutionary biologists to make the most out of progress in biology and other fields. For instance, some more implicit features of contemporary evolutionary thought, such as the assignment of causal and informational privileges to genes in development, or the treating of development and heredity as separate phenomena, remain prevalent in spite of new data that appear to challenge these assumptions — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>insights derived from research on: (i) evolutionary developmental biology (‘evo-devo’), (ii) developmental plasticity, (iii) inclusive inheritance, and (iv) niche construction are particularly instructive. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 2)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>We conclude that the EES is not just an extension of the MS but a distinctively different framework for understanding evolution, which, alongside more traditional perspectives, can be put to service constructively within the field. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Among the key empirical insights are that phenotypic variation often involves changes in the gene regulatory machinery that alters the timing, location, amount or type of gene product. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>As a consequence, developmental properties can affect the rates and patterns of phenotypic evolution — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>phenotypic variation can be biased by the processes of development, with some forms more probable than others — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Developmental bias may also contribute to the many examples of convergence across the tree of life. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>developmental bias suggests that phenotypic variation can be channelled and directed towards functional types by the processes of development — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>phenotypic, plasticity is the capacity of an organism to change its phenotype in response to the environment. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Phenotypic accommodation refers to the mutual and often functional adjustment of parts of an organism during development that typically does not involve genetic mutation — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>It has long been argued that phenotypic accommodation could promote genetic accommodation if environmentally induced phenotypes are subsequently stabilized and fine-tuned across generations by selection of standing genetic variation, previously cryptic genetic variation or newly arising mutations — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Consistent with these arguments, plasticity within species has been shown to generate parallel phenotypic differences to those exhibited by closely related species, and ancestral plasticity has been linked to evolutionary divergence among descendant lineages — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Parent –offspring similarity occurs not only because of transmission of DNA, but because parents transfer a variety of developmental resources that enable reconstruction of developmental niches — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>These include components of the egg and post-fertilization resources (e.g. hormones), behavioural interactions between parents and offspring (e.g. maternal care), parental modification of other components of the biotic and abiotic environment (e.g. host choice) and inheritance of symbionts directly through the mother’s germ cells or by infection. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>non-genetic inheritance can bias the expression and retention of environmentally induced phenotypes, thereby influencing the rate and direction of evolution — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>‘Niche construction’ refers to the process whereby the metabolism, activities and choices of organisms modify or stabilize environmental states, and thereby affect selection acting on themselves and other species — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Ecological inheritance refers to the accumulation of environmental changes, such as altered soil, atmosphere or ocean states that previous generations have brought about through their niche-constructing activity, and that influence the development of descendant organisms — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>(i) organisms modify environmental states in non-random ways, thereby imposing a systematic bias on the selection pressures they generate; (ii) ecological inheritance affects the evolutionary dynamics of descendants and contributes to the cross-generational stability of environmental conditions; (iii) acquired characters become evolutionarily significant by modifying selective environments; and (iv) the complementarity of organisms and their environments can be enhanced through niche construction (modifying environments to suit organisms), not just through natural selection — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the developing organism cannot be reduced to separable components, one of which (e.g. the genome) exerts exclusive control over the other (e.g. the phenotype). Rather, causation also flows back from ‘higher’ (i.e. more complex) levels of organismal organization to the genes (e.g. tissue-specific regulation of gene expression) — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>developmental system responds flexibly to internal and external inputs, most obviously through condition-dependent gene expression, but also through physical properties of cells and tissues and ‘exploratory behaviour’ among microtubular, neural, muscular and vascular systems. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Moczek [109] shows that genetic ‘blueprint’, ‘program’ or ‘instructions’ metaphors remain widespread in evolutionary biology texts. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 6)</p></blockquote><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>‘reciprocal causation’ simply means that process A is a cause of process B and, subsequently, process B is a cause of process A, with this feedback potentially repeated in causal chains. — (Laland et al., 2015, p. 6)</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.c2737d3ec1f70c1ec909ea32322fcfe8.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li><li><a href=/About-me>About me</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
