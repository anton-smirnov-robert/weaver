To give an example of a random sequence, he exhibited an uncomputable (see computability) number (Chaintin&amp;rsquo;s Omega) which is the probability that a Turing machine halts (see the halting problem) reading a randomly generated program (toss a coin to obtain binaries).</description></item><item><title>Kolmogorov's incompressibility</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Kolmogorovs-incompressibility/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Kolmogorovs-incompressibility/</guid><description>For Turing machines, a sequence of 0&amp;rsquo;s and 1&amp;rsquo;s is incompressible if it cannot be generated by a program shorter than the sequence itself.</description></item><item><title>protein folding problem</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/protein-folding-problem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/protein-folding-problem/</guid><description>How does a protein folds ? Levinthal&amp;rsquo;s paradox states that if the protein tries all configurations, it will take forever. However, it does fold.</description></item><item><title>Brillouin's relation between entropy and information</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Brillouins-relation-between-entropy-and-information/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Brillouins-relation-between-entropy-and-information/</guid><description>In 1951, Brilliouin related information and entropy to resolve Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s demon paradox; more precisely Shannon&amp;rsquo;s theory of information transmission and the second principle of thermodynamics.</description></item><item><title>computability</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/computability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/computability/</guid><description>Three notions of computability for a function are equivalent:
The existence of a Turing machine for computing the function. The abacus-computability.</description></item><item><title>Crick's central dogma</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Cricks-central-dogma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Cricks-central-dogma/</guid><description>It postulates that proteins never transmit &amp;ldquo;sequential information&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Sequential information&amp;rdquo; is to be understood as the sequence of bases in DNA or amino-acids in proteins.</description></item><item><title>Laplacian determinism</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Laplacian-determinism/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Laplacian-determinism/</guid><description>A demiurge could predict the future with solely the position and velocity of all particles in the universe. Laplace states that any deterministic system is therefore predictable.</description></item><item><title>Mendelian inheritance</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Mendelian-inheritance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Mendelian-inheritance/</guid><description>In 1865, the monk and botanist Gregor Mendel find that a trait can have different variants (alleles).
He did not used the word &amp;ldquo;gene&amp;rdquo;, this basic unit of heredity was called as such decades later.</description></item><item><title>Schrödinger's code-script aperiodic crystal</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Schrodingers-code-script-aperiodic-crystal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Schrodingers-code-script-aperiodic-crystal/</guid><description>In 1944, Schrödinger imagine that a “code-script” could be found in “aperiodic crystals” (chromosomes) of living systems ( Schrodinger1944).

Shannon relates the amount of information of one string to the amount of surprise of seeing it.</description></item><item><title>Turing machine</title><link>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Turing-machine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weaverbird.net/concept/Turing-machine/</guid><description>In 1936, Turing introduces the idea of a “computing machine”, latter called “Turing machine”.
