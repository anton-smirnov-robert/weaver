You might find annotations (coming from the PDF) between quotes, don't pay attention to that.\n- **notes**: they are most often literature notes, augmented summaries of documents, organized in terms of atomized and linked definitions, concepts, and references. \n\nAt the end of each page, you can access the local graph (with depth 2) around your location.\nTo get the big picture, you can also navigate by drag and zoom on the graph that contains all entries. \nTo do so, click on the name of the website in the top-left corner of the page. \nThe website is always in construction, but I try to be consistent when deploying online. \nHere are the technical aspects [[about the website]]. \n\n\n![](images/weaver.png)\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003csub\u003e Image: Village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus).

A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers.

The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded. The operating system read the instructions as it computes the program and change the input binary string. Increasing the complexity of the machine (e.g. alphabet, dimensions) does not change the class of functions it can computes ([recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)s). \n\n\n#### Details \n\n**What is the formal definition of a Turing machine ?** \nThe alphabet of the tape $\\Gamma$ can be thought to be 0's and 1's and blank's. \n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\text { A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, }\\left(Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, q_{0}, q_{\\text {accept }}, q_{\\text {reject }}\\right) \\text {, where } \\\\ Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma \\text { are all finite sets and } \\\\ \\text { 1. } Q \\text { is the set of states, } \\\\ \\text { 2. } \\Sigma \\text { is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol } \\sqcup \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 3. } \\Gamma \\text { is the tape alphabet, where } \\sqcup \\in \\Gamma \\text { and } \\Sigma \\subseteq \\Gamma \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 4. } \\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\longrightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times\\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\} \\text { is the transition function, } \\\\ \\text { 5. } q_{0} \\in Q \\text { is the start state, } \\\\ \\text { 6. } q_{\\text {accept }} \\in Q \\text { is the accept state, and } \\\\ \\text { 7. } q_{\\text {reject }} \\in Q \\text { is the reject state, where } q_{\\text {reject }} \\neq q_{\\text {accept }}\\end{array}$$\n\n**How to write the program (or diagram or table of instructions) in the machine ?**\n\nWe write $S_0=blank$ , $S_1=0$ and $S_2=1$, $R=move \\ right$, $L= move \\ left$ . \nAn instruction can be written $q_i S_i S_j R q_m$  or  $q_i S_i S_j L q_m$. We encode all instructions that define the Turing machine, as follows $$q_1 S_0 S_0 L q_2 ; q_2 S_1 S_2 L q_3 ; ... $$We write $q_i=DAAAA...A$ ($i$  times), $S_i=DCCC...C$ ($i$  times) and give a integer to each letter (A=1, C=2, D=3,...,;=7). Therefore, it gives a description number for the Turing machine $$313325117 ...$$There is a unique integer for a given machine, but we can always add unecessary programs (that change the number but that give the same result). This integer gets a binary decomposition$$01000101011010$$With the help of an additional small and instantaneous \"workspace\", it uses a [simple mecanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P66h8D5Lkwk) to read the programs and compute at the same time.\n\n\n#### Sources \n[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/#TuriDefi)   \n[MIT Open courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2020/pages/syllabus/)     \n[Sipser2013](reference/Sipser2013.md)\nnote [literature note on Longo2012](note/literature%20note%20on%20Longo2012.md)     \n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P66h8D5Lkwk)         \n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)       \n[Turing1936](reference/Turing1936.md)\n",

    "content": "\n*(english version to come)* \n\nLa naissance des sciences naturelles est intimement liée à une vision mécaniciste de la nature. De cette conception émane une épistémologie adaptée à l’étude de la matière inerte. La biologie, sous forte influence de la physique, peine à se démarquer de la discipline faite reine par construction. Au lieu de s’émanciper à un moment charnière de son histoire, cette discipline a plaqué le langage et l'imaginaire de l’informatique lorsqu’elle a découvert l’ADN. Les molécules incarnent des signaux reçus ou émis selon un programme génétique que l’on peut éditer. Les outils de la physique servent à l’étude d’une partie de corps (« hardware ») qui opère selon le code (« software ») qu’il véhicule. Le canard de Vaucanson se numérise, mais les métamorphoses permanentes du vivant demeurent comprises comme des erreurs d’un mécanisme, importantes pour l’évolution. Ainsi, le prix Nobel de biologie en 2020 confère à sa discipline la capacité de « reprogrammer » le vivant et « de contrôler l’évolution ». La théorie biologique toujours en vigueur, bien qu’elle soit remise en question par de nombreuses expériences, accepte cette affirmation péremptoire et erronée. En fait, nous traversons des crises biologiques et écologiques (chute de la biodiversité, insécurité alimentaire, résistances aux antibiotiques, abondance de perturbateurs endocriniens, épidémies d’épidémies, etc.) qui révèlent notre incapacité à comprendre rationnellement le vivant.\n\nL’exemple de la biologie montre la portée politique d’un manque de réflexivité en recherche. Une objectivité collective précieuse ne peut être constituée que par une science qui théorise, examine son épistémologie, connait son histoire et les conceptions philosophiques qu’elle embarque. Alors qu’elle doit constituer le cadre qui permet l’évaluation pharmakologique[^1]de techniques émergentes, la science promet aujourd’hui des « solutions » nano/géo/bio/psycho-technologiques automatiquement adoptées si elles voient le jour. Or la confiance dans le processus scientifique — et donc démocratique — des citoyens s’érode quand ils s’aperçoivent que les crises actuelles proviennent des « solutions » imposées hier sans débats. Dans la fuite en avant technologique d’un capitalisme repeint en vert, la recherche — qui la permet — doit porter un regard critique sur les connaissances qu’elle élabore. Plutôt que déserter, la question « Doit-on continuer la recherche scientifique ? » posée par Grothendiek en 1981 doit nous inviter à pænser la science de demain — libérée de son asservissement à la croissance économique. C’est un combat politique qui nécessite une exigence créative et un tâtonnement réfléchi au quotidien. \n\nComprendre le vivant au XXIe siècle sera crucial. La biologie doit assumer ses spécificités vis-à-vis de la physique en construisant sa propre épistémologie. Sur les épaules de penseurs contemporains qui ont souligné la nécessité d’une telle révolution ontologique, le conflit d’arguments empiriques et logiques doit faire rage. La rigueur scientifique ne réside pas dans la constance de principes implicites et intemporels, mais dans l’explicitation continue de ses règles évolutives. Le changement profond dont notre société a besoin se trouve une première fois dans ce travail. D’un point de vue opérationnel, une théorie des organismes enrayera notre « maladresse » destructrice du vivant, à entendre ici dans son sens le plus inclusif. \n\nSi les dernières décennies ont déconstruit beaucoup de nos croyances culturelles et montré leurs contingences, elles ont aussi souligné leur nécessité. Cependant, nous faisons face au vide conceptuel provoqué par le démantèlement des derniers refuges permettant des activités créatives (que ce soit en science, art ou philosophie). Nos fondations s’écroulent et nous ne sommes plus en mesure d’en construire de nouvelles. Outre des replis identitaires, des indifférences pathologiques ou des folies technosolutionnistes, la douce musique d’un nouvel animisme écologique nous prescrit de renier nos origines, faisant fi de notre histoire, et sans nous dire comment nous y prendre.

Polanyi : the distinction between a market system and the Republic of Science. \n\n### Hayek's market system  ([literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)).\n\n##### Hayek's contribution is identifying the mechanism of the market system\nBriefly, we sketch the essence of a market organization Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:\n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)\n\n##### Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes \nAccording to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 7) \n\nIn practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book *The Road to Serfdom* —, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.\n\n##### Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors\nHow, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 8) \n\nThe more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market _self-regulation_.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 10) \n\n\n##### The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)\nThe decentralized plans of _self-interested actors_ — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the _competition_ for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 11) \n\n\n### Polanyi's Republic of Science ([literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md))\n\nMicheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of *tacit knowledge* will be used by the OECD later. \n\nIn the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. \n\n\n##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. \n\nPolanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1].\n\nWhile Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).\n\n##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards\n\nHowever, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:\n\n1.  Plausibility\n2.  Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.\n3.  Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists\n\n##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves\n\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. \n\n##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science\nMoreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  \n\n\n\n## OECD comes into play: from the invisible hand to the implicit model.  ([literature note on Henriques2013](note/literature%20note%20on%20Henriques2013.md))\n\n#### Science become too important to be left to an invisible hand\nIn the 60's, several reasons bring experts to lean over science and technologies (S\u0026T) policies for the first time. First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer: \n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003eIf governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. (OECD, 1966: 8) — Government and Technical Innovation, Paris: OECD.\n\nThis input/output continuous model being *de facto* extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good. \n\nSecond, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two blocs threats each other with nuclear weapon. There is a need for being able to plan research activities. \n\nThird, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md), [Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. The market cannot anticipate what is good for societies, such as research should be funded by public institutions. \n\n#### The OECD led the international transformation of science\nIn this context, and based on those arguments, the OECD changed its role, which so far consisted in sharing good practices and tested policies among its members.  It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S\u0026T led by a group of experts. The model it constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). \n\n#### The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth\nThe OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needssome fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate resources on specific research area. Accordingly, quantitative indicators must be developed to assess to quality of science and refine policies: this is the birth of the Frascati manual, still in used nowadays.  \n\n\n## Frankenstein's invisible hand pushing scientists towards green, sustainable economic growth ([literature note on Paic2019](note/literature%20note%20on%20Paic2019.md))\n\n\nWhat happen if a purely liberal model of science — building on the invisible hand picture \"that guides scientists towards an unknown direction\" — is hijacked by centralizing science coordination and planning towards a precise goal? This question is interesting, but a better one is: what happens if this pardoxal situation is now given to neoliberals? Should they follow the ideas of their founding fathers or is the ability to push science towards a direction too tempting? \n\nSome aspects are retained or slightly modified. For instance, using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. Also, international competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs.\n\nSome aspects are transformed: \n\n- The linear model is no longer valid, it is the \"tacit knowledge\" (another idea of Polanyi) that cannot be transferred in the linear model of innovation. For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eGreater public-private collaboration in R\u0026D is strongly encouraged. (...) This is a strong trend, observed in all of the cases studied—  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 31) \n\n- The state should no longer plan science. It should follow what \"stakeholders\" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain. Goverment should be flexible because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficcient. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eCommitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) \n\nIn Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processig software and filtering out the majority by an unknown proecss, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the \"ivory tower\" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life.\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eGovernments need to demonstrate flexibility in setting priorities to be able to respond to increasingly rapid technological and societal evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ePolicy development sometimes requires consultations and long consensus-building processes, but parallel working groups and ad hoc committees must have room to manoeuvre in order to react more quickly to contextual evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) \n\n- \"Mission-oriented\" policies should be designed to solve grand societal challenges. There is an aim at managing scientists efforts. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThey are top-down initiatives responding to needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support (which has both advantages and disadvantages). —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 12) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis is meant to generate increased motivation among the actors – beyond remuneration and academic recognition, the awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause is an incentive for surpassing oneself —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 32) \n\nThe rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councis/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon. \n\n\u003e[!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eTo engage people. Make them part of the process. And proud to be European. Mark Zuckerberg talked about feeling part of something bigger in a recent speech. He was referring to a well-known story about John F Kennedy. The President visited the NASA space centre and saw a janitor carrying a broom. He walked over and asked what he was doing. And the janitor responded: “Mr President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That’s the kind of purpose I’m referring to. — ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/))\n\n\n- Subjects of \"mission-oriented\" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe large number of instruments and programmes available in most of the strategies studied makes it difficult for users to navigate among them and increases the risk of duplication. Rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance, reduce administrative costs (for participants and programme administrators), and maximise the impact of the strategy put in place. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) \n\nOverlap are no longer important.  This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality. \n\n\n## Principles for a new Science\n\n- The market needs an exogeous cause to change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. In practice, external events perturbing the cost of one commodity do occur all the time so that everything happen _as if_ prices were evolving because commodities were traded.\n- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.\n- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.\n- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2]. This will later be pointed out to be more general by other authors that introduce notions related to [Foucault's épistémè](concept/Foucault's%20épistémè.md). \n- The linear model of science is incompatible with revolutions in science ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)). \n- This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions. It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity. \n- Without overlap, there is no conflict (partition leads to \"cemeteries\" of ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)) . See also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) with what needs to be preserve \"pluralité conflictuelle de théories sur des arguments empirico-logique\"\n\n\n\n[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.\n[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.",

It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity. ",

(2021)         \nÉditions Matériologiques      \n\nReference: [LiVigni2021](reference/LiVigni2021.md)\n\n#### Complexity theories form an archipelago\nSeveral groups studied a form of [complexity](definition/complexity.md). There was the [Groupe des Dix](definition/Groupe%20des%20Dix.md), [complexity sciences](definition/complexity%20sciences.md), but also complexity in informatics (see e.g., [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md)). There is no one area, but several and different ones. \n\n#### Complexity sciences constitute a plateform rather than a discipline\n[complexity sciences](definition/complexity%20sciences.md) are not autonomous. They cannot preserve or reproduce their scientific activity in the traditional sense (no courses, no social existence in universities, no specific allocation or commission at CNRS for instance). However, they share theoretical stances, collaborate and recognize each other with topics (chaos, network, emergence, etc.). Scientists are not specialists of complexity, they rather have a **dual role** and complexity appears on their CV in second or third position. It is, however, more than a mere trend because it lasts throughout time, a community persists. In a nutshell, it is rather a **scientific platform.** \n\n#### Complexity sciences rely on classical ontologies and epistemologies\nStructure of scientific argumentation rely on Ockham's razor, toy modeling, **statistics**, **mathematical modeling**, and proof of concept. [backcasting](definition/backcasting.md) is also often used. Scientists usually assimilate the formal cause (not the material cause) of models to the one of reality, like in physics.\n\n\n#### Selected references\n\n[Horgan1995](reference/Horgan1995.md)\n[Israel2005](reference/Israel2005.md)\n[Deffuant2015](reference/Deffuant2015.md)\n",

(2012)   \n*Progress in biophysics and molecular biology* 109: 108-114      \nDOI: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.004\n\nReference: [Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)\n\n\n#### The central dogma of biology was formulated during the thriving era of computer programs.\nThe concepts of [computability](concept/computability.md) (hardware, software), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developed in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (and cryptography played a major role during this period), [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology that explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA.\n\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologits to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\nIt relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). This view directly eliminates the radical materiality of living organisms. For instance, Maynard Smith states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThere is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process (...) —  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n \n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n\n#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology\nMoreover, information is not well-defined for the living because it has ambiguous links with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](concept/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by Schrödinger ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)), it seems that organisms manage to \"resist\" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cell to cell, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (hemodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial ([Lucitti2007](reference/Lucitti2007.md), [Tang2004](reference/Tang2004.md), [Muller2003](reference/Muller2003.md), [Rot-Nikcevic2007](reference/Rot-Nikcevic2007.md), [Jakkaraju2003](reference/Jakkaraju2003.md)).  \n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "\n#### **Computational empiricism : the reigning épistémè of the sciences**     \nby Montevil M. (2021)         \n\n**Abstract**:  What do mainstream scientists acknowledge as original scientific contributions? In other words, what is the current épistémè in natural sciences? This essay attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical, generating data and computational, to analyze them and reproduce them with models. This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.\n\nReference: [Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)\n\n\n### Summary\n\n\n#### The IMRaD structure is about contextualizing a single unbiased observation to transform it to knowledge.\nIt is like adding a single brick on the cathedral of knowledge. The separation of results and discussion means that your mind is a virgin receptacle for information to flow inside. Then, you analyze the results that you have unbiasly seen. With the IMRaD format, scientists exchange information without being transformed (receptor, receiver). This is not theoretial thinking since the latter change how we think about phenomena. In fact, scientists do not have time to engage with specific ways to organize scientific rationality.\n\n#### Experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world, that is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from an interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon\n\nThere is a confusion between objectivity and automation. You can make something automatic with a deep unoticed theoretical commitment. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eprotocolization can also be counterproductive since it downplays the work of objectivation, that is to say, the articulation between procedures and theoretical thinking. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 5) \n\n\n#### The current épistémè still has a positivist influence\nThe scientific aim in the current épistémè is to find causal patterns or \"mechanisms\". Case studies or not considered, but they can give useful insights: the existence of one planet, the fact that something is possible, etc. The kind of knowledge that is looked for points to [scientific positivism](concept/scientific%20positivism.md). The épistémè builds on induction and is a kind of empiricism.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ecomputational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations. It cares for numerical questions (like statistics); however, it does not attend its logoi significantly, by analytical means or otherwise. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n#### Review articles contrast with original research in the current épistémè, except when statistical meta-analysis are performed\nAs review articles are typically required to be critical, the computational statistical analysis seems to considered more original then subjective critics. Review articles are requested by editors, which are often not researchers. With the massification and acceleration of scientific production, synthetic works should be valuable. They are not. However, theorization has a synthetic function.\n\n#### Modelling is specific to a phenomena, is not theoretical work and need to be included in a theoretical framework\nHowever, like in Planck's quanta case, it can be the starting point for a broader general framework. Most models are mathematical (and computational). They aim to imitate several properties with precision. Theoretical work confers a profound scientific meaning to the properties of models (Planck's quanta). Mathematical modelling is not theoretical work when it is local. When it results from a theoretical move, with original mathematical tools, it is then a part of theoritization. For instance, mathematical tools that originate from physics and transferred to biology convey implicit considerations. Models need to be included in a theoretical framework.\n\n#### Computational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations\nIt cares for numerical questions but do not attend for its logoi. Original works are empirical, generating data to analyze and reproducing them with models. In empirical works, the approach is inductive although statistical Popperian tests are usually conducted. In computational models, the ability to fit empirical data prevail on theoretical consistency or significance.\n\n\n#### The épistémè has some links with the organization of science\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eComputational empiricism is an industrialization of research activity, a paradoxical notion considering that research is about bringing new, singular insights. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis organization goes with a cumulative view of science, where productivism is a natural aim. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n#### Computational empiricism produces a state of theory disruption\nMontévil name the current épistémè _computational empiricism_. Most scientists adopt an _inductive_ approach: they generate data, analyze them and/or try to reproduce them using specific models. The analysis are predominantly statistical tests and mathematical models primarly aim at imitation. They are carried out on computers and the theoretical meaning they bear is usually not discussed. Two observations point to a _cumulative_ view of knowledge. First, the standardization of the publication structure, which contextualize a single unbiased observation to communicate an easy-to-find information to other scientists. Second, synthetic works taking place in critical and editor-ordered review articles are explicitely not considered to be original contributions unless they undertake computational meta-analysis. Finally, in the spirit of Bernard Stielger, the author diagnozed a phenomena he calls _theory disruption_, defined as follow:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn a somewhat perverse way, it also promotes empirical results that destabilize former theoretical frameworks because they catch attention. However, it does not promote rethinking these frameworks, leading to what may be called a theory disruption that is more or less advanced depending on the fields —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n### Comments\nSee also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) — Chapter Theorie and methods.

    "content": "\n#### **Governance of science and technology policies**     \nby Paic A., Viros C. (2019)         \nOECD      \n\nReference: [Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)\n\nWhat happen if a purely liberal model of science — building on the invisible hand picture \"that guides scientists towards an unknown direction\" — is hijacked by centralizing science coordination and planning towards a precise goal? This question is interesting, but a better one is: what happens if this pardoxal situation is now given to neoliberals? Should they follow the ideas of their founding fathers or is the ability to push science towards a direction too tempting? \n\nSome aspects are retained or slightly modified: \n\n- Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. \n- International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs.\n\nSome aspects are transformed: \n\n- The linear model is no longer valid, it is the \"tacit knowledge\" (another idea of Polanyi) that cannot be transferred in the linear model of innovation. For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eGreater public-private collaboration in R\u0026D is strongly encouraged. (...) This is a strong trend, observed in all of the cases studied—  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 31) \n\n- The state should no longer plan science. It should follow what \"stakeholders\" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eCommitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) \n\nIn Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processig software and filtering out the majority by an unknown proecss, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the \"ivory tower\" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life.\n\n- It should be flexible because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficcient. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eGovernments need to demonstrate flexibility in setting priorities to be able to respond to increasingly rapid technological and societal evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ePolicy development sometimes requires consultations and long consensus-building processes, but parallel working groups and ad hoc committees must have room to manoeuvre in order to react more quickly to contextual evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) \n\n- \"Mission-oriented\" policies should be designed to solve grand societal challenges. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThey are top-down initiatives responding to needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support (which has both advantages and disadvantages). —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 12) \n\nBeyond being short-term projects with predetermined results, there is an aim at managing scientists efforts. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis is meant to generate increased motivation among the actors – beyond remuneration and academic recognition, the awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause is an incentive for surpassing oneself —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 32) \n\nExamples such as nuclear energy, or conquest of space are given. It seems that the ideology of all scientists is also fixed. Do all scientists need to believe that we should \"conquer space\". Is there an ideological engagement when making basic research?  Other examples are green growth for instance. First, one should endorse the idea that it is a good and real thing (Tordjman). There is a ideaological commitment in being a scientist. \n\n\u003e[!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eTo engage people. Make them part of the process. And proud to be European. Mark Zuckerberg talked about feeling part of something bigger in a recent speech. He was referring to a well-known story about John F Kennedy. The President visited the NASA space centre and saw a janitor carrying a broom. He walked over and asked what he was doing. And the janitor responded: “Mr President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That’s the kind of purpose I’m referring to. — ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/))\n\nThe rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councis/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon. \n\n- Subjects of \"mission-oriented\" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe large number of instruments and programmes available in most of the strategies studied makes it difficult for users to navigate among them and increases the risk of duplication. Rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance, reduce administrative costs (for participants and programme administrators), and maximise the impact of the strategy put in place. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) \n\nOverlap are no longer important. No conflict (\"cemeteries\" of Montevil). See also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md). \n \n#### Comments \n\nWhose money? Public money, citizens. Who decides? Stakeholders, that is citizens and the private sector — the state should not interfere, only to be \"vigilant\".  This is the market of ideas. Offer and demand. Consumers are citizens and the private sector. However, the money comes citizens. The private sector does not invest whatsoever in this mechanism. They only ask which directions to pursue annd use the fruit of research. \n\nWe go back to a market system, but this is not at the scale of Polanyi. Scientists are sellers that respond to the demand of public/industrials.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n- Do citizens really decide? \n\nThe role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented.  It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal. \n\n- Can stakeholders know what is good for them ? \n\nThe market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want. However, there is no problem, \"should be monitored vigilantly by governments\".  It does not, it is incompatible [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). \n\nIn any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV? (such as the meaning of \"islamo-gauchism\"). *The scientific activity is against the doxa.* \n\n#### Idea \n\n- What is the linear model with [Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md) ?\n- \n- We gave up on the idea that science is a creative activity, and we cannot determine what will happen and what can be useful. Nothing can be created. How to engage that without any garuantee. \nEmpirical research with automation of protocoles aims at eliminating everything that can be creative. We want to predefine what will be obtained. Purely empirical investigations negates that human plays a role in constructing theories. What want to control what to look for and why. Important scientific results come from unexpected results. We cannot predict, but need to trust this. As long as we cannot trust the fact that something can emerge from nothing. Being is being determined. Nothing can be created.  \n\n- La confiance entre scientifiques et la population est ébranlée parce que ces derniers, sous la pression de publier, se mettent à faire jouer les \"commercial morals\" (c'est à dire, mon papier est bon car il est accepté). Dès lors, il découle une énorme crise de reproductibilité et la plupart des choses qui en sorte ne sont pas fiable.  Ils vendent des choses fragiles et font des énormes promesses. \n\n- Credit import recherche de plus en plus grand pour moins de recherche. \n\n- La tour d'ivoire est crée par le simple fait de différencier les scientifiques des citoyens. Les sccientifiques sont des citoyens et eds humains qui ont des pensées qui reflètent en partie ceux de la société. La tour d'ivoir est illusoire, elle fait comme-ci ces dderniers étaient neutres et objecctifs, près à travailler sur les sujets qu'on leur pointe du doigts. \n\n- Innovation is technological, aims at economic growth, and can only impact societies positively.

    "content": "\n## **The Republic of science**     \nby Polanyi M. (1962)         \n*Minerva* 1: 54-73       \nDOI: 10.1007/BF01101453     \n\nReference: [Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)\n\n\n#### Background\n\nMicheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of *tacit knowledge* will be used by the OECD later. \n\nIn the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. \n\n#### Summary \n\n##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. \n\nPolanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1].\n\nWhile Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).\n\n##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards\n\nHowever, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:\n\n1.  Plauiability\n2.  Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.\n3.  Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists\n\n##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves\n\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. \n\n##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science\nMoreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.\n- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.\n- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2]. This will later be pointed out to be more general by other authors that introduce notions related to [Foucault's épistémè](concept/Foucault's%20épistémè.md). \n\n\u003e[!warning]\n\u003e \n\u003eNeoliberalism was not the dominant ideology in the Western world at that time. The Republic of Science is more related to a liberal view of science, in the classical view, without state intervention. Sixty years later, we find an era of neoliberalism in science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)), but this has nothing to do with what is suggested here. \n\n\n[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.\n[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.",

Three Reasons Why It Is Questionable and Calls for a Radical Transformation of the Concept of Innovation**     \nby Blok V., Lemmens P. (2015)         \nSpringer International Publishing      \nKoops B., Oosterlaken I., Romijn H., Swierstra T., van den Hoven J.      \n\n**Abstract**:  In this chapter, we challenge the presupposed concept of innovation in the responsible innovation literature. As a first step, we raise several questions with regard to the possibility of ‘responsible’ innovation and point at several difficulties which undermine the supposedly responsible character of innovation processes, based on an analysis of the input, throughput and output of innovation processes. It becomes clear that the practical applicability of the concept of responsible innovation is highly problematic and that a more thorough inquiry of the concept is required. As a second step, we analyze the concept of innovation which is self-evidently presupposed in current literature on responsible innovation. It becomes clear that innovation is self-evidently seen as (1) technological innovation, (2) is primarily perceived from an economic perspective, (3) is inherently good and (4) presupposes a symmetry between moral agents and moral addressees. By challenging this narrow and uncritical concept of innovation, we contribute to a second round of theorizing about the concept and provide a research agenda for future research in order to enhance a less naïve concept of responsible innovation.\n\n",

This 2007 fifth edition has been thoroughly revised by John Burgess. Including a selection of exercises, adjusted for this edition, at the end of each chapter, it offers a simpler treatment of the representability of recursive functions, a traditional stumbling block for students on the way to the Godel incompleteness theorems.

(2002)         \nHarvard University Press      \n\n**Abstract**:  The oracle at Delphi posed a question concerning a boat: If, in time, every plank has rotted and been replaced, is the boat the same boat? Yes, the owner will say, the vessel is not its planks but the relationship between them. Similarly, Antoine Danchin argues in this provocative book, life itself is not revealed just by its components--DNA, ribosomes, genes, cells--but also by their relationships. By the end of 2001, almost 500 genome programs were completed or under way. Drawing upon what researchers worldwide are learning from the gene sequences of bacteria, plants, fungi, fruit flies, worms, and humans, Danchin shows us how genomes are far more than mere collections of genes. They are the means of transmitting the system of relationships making up a living cell from one generation to the next. Genomes are codes that govern the construction, operation, and survival of cells. The Delphic Boat shows us that life is both a complicated piece of chemical machinery that decodes genomes and a process that builds this machinery. The laws of physics or chemistry can only predict so much of this process. To truly understand life, we must understand spatial and temporal relationships between molecules that make up the cell, and how these molecules are coordinated. Danchin persuades us that if we can reach this level of understanding of genomes, we will be able to resolve the major biological puzzle of the twenty-first century: the enigma of the living machine that creates the living machine.\n\n",

(2009)         \n*Science as Culture* 18: 23-46       \nDOI: 10.1080/09505430802705889     \n\n**Abstract**:  Michael Polanyi spent his long career thinking and writing about the workings of science and the scientific community. Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay, ‘The Republic of Science’. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the tacit dimension in knowledge formation—or what he described as ‘personal knowledge’. On the one hand, his political essay supports a classical conservative position, while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's own ‘fiduciary community’—in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Society—shaped his theoretical conceptualization of the so-called ‘republic of science’. In this way, Polanyi's political contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political thought.\n\n",

It challenges the idea that world is “simple.” To the reductionist idea that each process is the sum of the actions of its components it opposes a holistic view (the whole is more than the sum of the parts). The aim of the present article is to analyze the epistemological status attributed in the science of complexity to several fundamental ideas, such as those of scientific law, objectivity, and prediction. The aim is to show that the hope of superseding reductionism by means of concepts such as that of “emergence” is fallacious and that the science of complexity proposes forms of reductionism that are even more restrictive than the classical ones, particularly when it claims to unify in a single treatment problems that vary widely in nature such as physical, biological, and social problems.\n\n",

Several philosophers and biologists have argued against adopting this concept based on epistemological and ontological arguments, and also, because it encouraged genetic determinism. While the theories of elaboration and transmission of information are valid mathematical theories, their own logic and implicit causal structure make them inimical to biology, and because of it, their applications have and are hindering the development of a sound theory of organisms.

Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a-/-). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood. These data show that hemodynamic force is necessary and sufficient to induce vessel remodeling in the mammalian yolk sac.\n\n",

Progress in robotics will help to make life easier, richer and healthier. Wider robot use will help raise labour productivity. As science and engineering progress, robots will become more central to crisis response, from helping combat infectious diseases to maintaining critical infrastructure. Governments can accelerate and orient the development and uptake of socially valuable robots, for instance by: supporting cross-disciplinary R\u0026amp;D, facilitating research commercialisation, helping small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) understand the opportunities for investment in robots, supporting platforms that highlight robot solutions in healthcare and other sectors, embedding robotics engineering in high school curricula, tailoring training for workers with vocational-level mechanical skills, supporting data development useful to robotics, ensuring flexible regulation conducive to innovation, strengthening digital connectivity, and raising awareness of the importance of robotics.\n\n",

As countries strive to resolve societal challenges, “mission-oriented” approaches complement traditional ones centred on national competitiveness, specific industrial sectors or technologies. Governance settings contribute overall to a more inclusive, transparent and responsible STI system, in particular through a whole-of-government approach, the consultation of academia, the private sector and civil society, the implementation of strategies by professional agencies, and the increasingly common use of evaluation.

(1988)         \nPerseus Books      \n\n**Abstract**:  Evolution of self-replicating macromolecules through natural selection is a dynamically ordered process. Two concepts are introduced to describe the physical regularity of macromolecular evolution: sequence space and quasi-species. Natural selection means localization of a mutant distribution in sequence space. This localized distribution, called the quasi-species, is centered around a master sequence (or a degenerate set), that the biologist would call the wild-type. The self-ordering of such a system is an essential consequence of its formation through self-reproduction of its macromolecular consti tuents, a process that in the dynamical equations expresses itself by positive diagonal coefficients called selective values. The theory describes how population numbers of wild type and mutants are related to the distribution of selective values, that is to say, how value topography maps into population topography. For selectively (nearly) neutral mutants appearing in the quasi- species distribution, population numbers are greatly enhanced as compared to those of disadvantageous mutants, even more so in continuous domains of such selectively valuable mutants. As a consequence, mutants far distant from the wild type may occur because they are produced with the help of highly populated, less distant precursors. Since values are cohesively distributed, like mountains on earth, and since their positions are multiply connected in the high-dimensional sequence space, the overpopulation of (nearly) neural mutants provides guidance for the evolutionary process. Localization in sequence space, subject to a threshold in the fidelity of reproduction, is steadily challenged until an optimal state is reached. The model has been designed according to experimentally determined properties of self-replicating molecules. The conclusions reached from the theoretical models can be used to construct machines that provide optimal conditions for the evolution of functional macromolecules.\n\n",

(1944)         \nCambridge University Press      \n\n**Abstract**:  Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger's What is Life? is one of the great science classics of the twentieth century. A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.\n\n",
