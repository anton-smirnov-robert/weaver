He pictures not a mecanism but a person — “Turing's architect” according to ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)) Turing introduced ([Turing1936](reference/Turing1936.md)) this machine trying to answer questions regarding decidability. A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers. It requires a (readable, writtable, and movable) infinite 1D bit register — a tape. Turing has shown that those elementary instructions are enough to do elaborate any sophisticated program that are themselves encoded on the tape. The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded. The operating system read the instructions as it computes the program and change the input binary string. Increasing the complexity of the machine (e.g. alphabet, dimensions) does not change the class of functions it can computes ([recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)s). \n\n\n#### Details \n\n**What is the formal definition of a Turing machine ?** \nThe alphabet of the tape $\\Gamma$ can be thought to be 0's and 1's and blank's. \n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\text { A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, }\\left(Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, q_{0}, q_{\\text {accept }}, q_{\\text {reject }}\\right) \\text {, where } \\\\ Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma \\text { are all finite sets and } \\\\ \\text { 1. } Q \\text { is the set of states, } \\\\ \\text { 2. } \\Sigma \\text { is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol } \\sqcup \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 3. } \\Gamma \\text { is the tape alphabet, where } \\sqcup \\in \\Gamma \\text { and } \\Sigma \\subseteq \\Gamma \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 4. } \\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\longrightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times\\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\} \\text { is the transition function, } \\\\ \\text { 5. } q_{0} \\in Q \\text { is the start state, } \\\\ \\text { 6. } q_{\\text {accept }} \\in Q \\text { is the accept state, and } \\\\ \\text { 7. } q_{\\text {reject }} \\in Q \\text { is the reject state, where } q_{\\text {reject }} \\neq q_{\\text {accept }}\\end{array}$$\n\n**How to write the program (or diagram or table of instructions) in the machine ?**\n\nWe write $S_0=blank$ , $S_1=0$ and $S_2=1$, $R=move \\ right$, $L= move \\ left$ . \nAn instruction can be written $q_i S_i S_j R q_m$  or  $q_i S_i S_j L q_m$. We encode all instructions that define the Turing machine, as follows $$q_1 S_0 S_0 L q_2 ; q_2 S_1 S_2 L q_3 ; ... $$We write $q_i=DAAAA...A$ ($i$  times), $S_i=DCCC...C$ ($i$  times) and give a integer to each letter (A=1, C=2, D=3,...,;=7). Therefore, it gives a description number for the Turing machine $$313325117 ...$$There is a unique integer for a given machine, but we can always add unecessary programs (that change the number but that give the same result). This integer gets a binary decomposition$$01000101011010$$With the help of an additional small and instantaneous \"workspace\", it uses a [simple mecanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P66h8D5Lkwk) to read the programs and compute at the same time.\n\n\n#### Sources \n[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/#TuriDefi)   \n[MIT Open courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2020/pages/syllabus/)     \n[Sipser2013](reference/Sipser2013.md)\nnote [note on Longo2012](note/note%20on%20Longo2012.md)     \n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P66h8D5Lkwk)         \n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)       \n[Turing1936](reference/Turing1936.md)\n",

In 1944, [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) first hint at *informational* content in chromosomes in 1944 ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of computation and [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA in terms of transmission of information from DNA to proteins.\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologist to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\n[Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins. This view ignore the materiality of living organisms, because the software should works on all hardwares in this framework. For instance, Maynard-Smith (that tries to explicitate the notion of information in biology without managing to distinguish Turing and Shannon's difference between elaboration and transmission of information) states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThere is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process (...) —  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n\n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**, **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology\nInformation is not well-defined in biology, but it also has an ambiguous link with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](definition/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by Schrödinger, it seems that organisms manage to \"resist\" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cell to cell, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (themodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial. There is no space and time in this framework. \n\n\n\n\n",

Shortly thereafter, during the ascent of molecular biology, the concept of information was rapidly transferred into biology at large. Several philosophers and biologists have argued against adopting this concept based on epistemological and ontological arguments, and also, because it encouraged genetic determinism. While the theories of elaboration and transmission of information are valid mathematical theories, their own logic and implicit causal structure make them inimical to biology, and because of it, their applications have and are hindering the development of a sound theory of organisms. Our analysis concentrates on the development of information theories in mathematics and on the differences between these theories regarding the relationship among complexity, information and entropy.\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  (Longo et al., 2012, p. 6) \n\n\n\n",

In an accessible and elegant style, the authors present the successes and challenges of a new DNA-modifying technique: CRISPR. They transmit their emotions of discovery, passion for research, and intellectual audacity. While greatly admiring the technical skills of the authors, who are among the best researchers in the field, this review critically stresses the limits of their experimental practices, namely: a vague or incomplete theoretical frame; often unreachable genetic targets; off-target effects; prior failures to deliver by other forms of genetic manipulation, and, finally, the intrinsic unpredictability of many phenotypic consequences of such a powerful technique. Due to these concerns, the authors’ approach to organisms and Evolution is questioned with the purpose to generate an open debate.\n\n",

(1944)         \nCambridge University Press      \n\n**Abstract**:  Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger's What is Life? is one of the great science classics of the twentieth century. A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.\n\n",
