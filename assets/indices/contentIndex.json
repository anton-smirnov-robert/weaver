    "content": "\n## **Is Information a proper observable for biological organization?**     \nby Longo G., Miquel P., Sonnenschein C., Soto A.M. (2012)   \n*Progress in biophysics and molecular biology* 109: 108-114      \nDOI: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.004\n\nReference: [Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)\n\n\n#### The central dogma of biology was formulated during the thriving era of computer programs.\nThe concepts of [computability](concept/computability.md) (hardware, software), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developed in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (and cryptography played a major role during this period), [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology that explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA.\n\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologits to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\nIt relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). This view directly eliminates the radical materiality of living organisms. For instance, Maynard Smith (that tries to explicitate the notion of information in biology without managing to distinguish Turing and Shannon'concepts) states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThere is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process (...) â€”  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n\n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n\n#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology\nMoreover, information is not well-defined for the living because it has ambiguous links with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](definition/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by SchrÃ¶dinger ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)), it seems that organisms manage to \"resist\" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. â€”  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cell to cell, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (themodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial ([Lucitti2007](reference/Lucitti2007.md), [Tang2004](reference/Tang2004.md), [Muller2003](reference/Muller2003.md), [Rot-Nikcevic2007](reference/Rot-Nikcevic2007.md), [Jakkaraju2003](reference/Jakkaraju2003.md)).  \n\n\n\n\n",
