      "abstractNote": "Two identities in statistical mechanics involving entropy differences (or ratios of densities of states) at constant energy are derived. The first provides a nontrivial extension of the Jarzynski equality to the microcanonical ensemble [C. Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)], which can be seen as a “fast-switching” version of the adiabatic switching method for computing entropies [M. Watanabe and W. P. Reinhardt, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 3301 (1990)]. The second is a thermodynamic integration formula analogous to a well-known expression for free energies, and follows after taking the quasistatic limit of the first. Both identities can be conveniently used in conjunction with a scaling relation (herein derived) that allows one to extrapolate measurements taken at a single energy to a wide range of energy values. Practical aspects of these identities in the context of numerical simulations are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Citations are increasingly used as performance indicators in research policy and within the research system. Usually, citations are assumed to reflect the impact of the research or its quality. What is the justification for these assumptions and how do citations relate to research quality? These and similar issues have been addressed through several decades of scientometric research. This article provides an overview of some of the main issues at stake, including theories of citation and the interpretation and validity of citations as performance measures. Research quality is a multidimensional concept, where plausibility/soundness, originality, scientific value, and societal value commonly are perceived as key characteristics. The article investigates how citations may relate to these various research quality dimensions. It is argued that citations reflect aspects related to scientific impact and relevance, although with important limitations. On the contrary, there is no evidence that citations reflect other key dimensions of research quality. Hence, an increased use of citation indicators in research evaluation and funding may imply less attention to these other research quality dimensions, such as solidity/plausibility, originality, and societal value.",

      "abstractNote": "Competition among scientists for funding, positions and prestige, among other things, is often seen as a salutary driving force in U.S. science. Its effects on scientists, their work and their relationships are seldom considered. Focus-group discussions with 51 mid- and early-career scientists, on which this study is based, reveal a dark side of competition in science. According to these scientists, competition contributes to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage of others’ ability to use one’s work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct. When competition is pervasive, such effects may jeopardize the progress, efficiency and integrity of science.",

      "abstractNote": "Research summary: In this article, we document a shift away from science by large corporations between 1980 and 2006. We find that publications by company scientists have declined over time in a range of industries. We also find that the value attributable to scientific research has dropped, whereas the value attributable to technical knowledge (as measured by patents) has remained stable. These trends are unlikely to be driven principally by changes in publication practices. Furthermore, science continues to be useful as an input into innovation. Our evidence points to a reduction of the private benefits of internal research. Large firms still value the golden eggs of science (as reflected in patents), but seem to be increasingly unwilling to invest in the golden goose itself (the internal scientific capabilities). Managerial summary: There is a widespread belief among commentators that large American corporations are withdrawing from research. Large corporations may still collaborate with universities and acquire promising science-based start-ups, but their labs increasingly focus on developing existing knowledge and commercializing it, rather than creating new knowledge. In this article, we combine firm-level financial information with a large and comprehensive data set on firm publications, patents and acquisitions to quantify the withdrawal from science by large American corporations between 1980 and 2006. This withdrawal is associated with a decline in the private value of research activities, even though scientific knowledge itself remains important for corporate invention. We discuss the managerial and policy implications of our findings.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper proposes a systemic perspective for some aspects of both phylogenesis and ontogenesis by expressing biological organization in terms of \"anti-entropy\", a notion to be defined below and which conceptually differs from the common use of \"negative entropy\". To this purpose, we introduce two principles, in addition to the thermodynamic ones, which are (mathematically) compatible with traditional principles but which have no meaning with regard to inert matter. A traditional balance equation for the metabolism will then be extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We examine far from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of global entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A close analysis of anti-entropy will be performed from the perspective of a diffusion equation of biomass over \"complexity\" and, as a complementary approach and as a tool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schrödinger's method regarding his equation in the field of Quantum Mechanics. We borrow only the operatorial approach from this equation and do so using a classical framework, since we use real coefficients instead of complex ones, thus outside of the mathematical framework of quantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple mathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over complexity as it applies to evolution. We then present, based on the existence of different time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy and anti-entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze the metabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant coefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which fit empirical data. Finally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed, also in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).",

      "abstractNote": "The regulatory genome functions as a vast information processor through development. It processes the initial conditions that are set by asymmetric distributions of cellular components in the egg and translates them into the onset of spatially localized specification states. It regulates the timely differential activation of signaling molecules and transcription factors that divide the emerging domains into subdomains. It also governs the activation of groups of differentiation genes, the genes that encode, at the protein level, the functional and the structural properties of a cell type. The sea urchin endomesoderm gene regulatory network provides a window into the different levels of the regulatory apparatus. It demonstrates how the static physical genomic components define functional connections between the various regulatory genes that act together to conduct the dynamical developmental program.",

      "abstractNote": "We define predictive information I\n              pred\n              (T) as the mutual information between the past and the future of a time series. Three qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation times T: I\n              pred\n              (T) can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a finite number of parameters, then I\n              pred\n              (T) grows logarithmically with a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast, power-law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite parameter (or non-parametric) models such as continuous functions with smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning theory and the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Furthermore, in the same way that entropy provides the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of I\n              pred\n              (T) provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in problems in physics, statistics, and biology.",

      "abstractNote": "Endocrinologists apply the idea of feedback loops to explain how hormones regulate certain bodily functions such as glucose metabolism. In particular, feedback loops focus on the maintenance of the plasma concentrations of glucose within a narrow range. Here, we put forward a different, organicist perspective on the endocrine regulation of glycaemia, by relying on the pivotal concept of closure of constraints. From this perspective, biological systems are understood as organized ones, which means that they are constituted of a set of mutually dependent functional structures acting as constraints, whose maintenance depends on their reciprocal interactions. Closure refers specifically to the mutual dependence among functional constraints in an organism. We show that, when compared to feedback loops, organizational closure can generate much richer descriptions of the processes and constraints at play in the metabolism and regulation of glycaemia, by making explicit the different hierarchical orders involved. We expect that the proposed theoretical framework will open the way to the construction of original mathematical models, which would provide a better understanding of endocrine regulation from an organicist perspective.",

      "abstractNote": "In this chapter, we challenge the presupposed concept of innovation in the responsible innovation literature. As a first step, we raise several questions with regard to the possibility of ‘responsible’ innovation and point at several difficulties which undermine the supposedly responsible character of innovation processes, based on an analysis of the input, throughput and output of innovation processes. It becomes clear that the practical applicability of the concept of responsible innovation is highly problematic and that a more thorough inquiry of the concept is required. As a second step, we analyze the concept of innovation which is self-evidently presupposed in current literature on responsible innovation. It becomes clear that innovation is self-evidently seen as (1) technological innovation, (2) is primarily perceived from an economic perspective, (3) is inherently good and (4) presupposes a symmetry between moral agents and moral addressees. By challenging this narrow and uncritical concept of innovation, we contribute to a second round of theorizing about the concept and provide a research agenda for future research in order to enhance a less naïve concept of responsible innovation.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose and analyse a general model of priority races. Researchers privately have breakthroughs and decide how long to let their ideas mature before disclosing them, thereby establishing priority. Two-researcher, symmetric priority races have a unique equilibrium that can be characterized by a differential equation. We study how the shapes of the breakthrough distribution and of the returns to maturation affect maturation delays and research quality, both in dynamic and comparative statics analyses. Making researchers better at discovering new ideas or at developing them has contrasted effects on research quality. Being closer to the technological frontier enhances the value of maturation for researchers, which mitigates the negative impact on research quality of the race for priority. Finally, when researchers differ in their abilities to do creative work or in the technologies they use to develop their ideas, more efficient researchers always let their ideas mature more than their less efficient opponents. Our theoretical results shed light on academic competition, patent races, and innovation quality.",

This 2007 fifth edition has been thoroughly revised by John Burgess. Including a selection of exercises, adjusted for this edition, at the end of each chapter, it offers a simpler treatment of the representability of recursive functions, a traditional stumbling block for students on the way to the Godel incompleteness theorems. This updated edition is also accompanied by a website as well as an instructor's manual.",

Cette étude propose d'expliquer dans quelle mesure la sociologie s'est appropriée les thématiques environnementales et quelles sont les conséquences de cette ouverture du point de vue des traditions intellectuelles et des contextes nationaux.<br />L'histoire des liens de la sociologie avec le milieu naturel sera d'abord retracée avant l'analyse des fondements de la sociologie contemporaine de l'environnement et de ses principaux courants contemporains. On détaillera alors la récente institutionnalisation du domaine en France, notamment rendue visible par ses caractères extérieurs. La revendication d'une approche sociologique de l'environnement s'est heurtée, dans ce pays, à l'emprise d'une sociologie traditionnellement limitée aux réalités strictement sociales, mais également à une appropriation de l'environnement par les politiques gouvernementales et de recherche.<br />Cette dernière analyse fait de cette étude de cas un véritable travail de sociologie des sciences et rappelle la nécessité de penser la science comme une institutionnalisation de l'activité cognitive. D'ailleurs, cette recherche conduira à interpréter les effets de la prise en compte d'une sociologie de l'environnement sur la structure des sciences elle-même. L'ancien découpage entre sciences naturelles et sociales sera nuancé au profit d'une mise à plat des relations entre les phénomènes écologiques et sociologiques favorisant le traitement tout à la fois des réalités sociales, naturelles et environnementales et de leurs actions réciproques.",

      "abstractNote": "Selecting among alternative projects is a core management task in all innovating organizations. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of frontier scientific research projects. We argue that the “intellectual distance” between the knowledge embodied in research proposals and an evaluator’s own expertise systematically relates to the evaluations given. To estimate relationships, we designed and executed a grant proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized the assignment of evaluators and proposals to generate 2,130 evaluator–proposal pairs. We find that evaluators systematically give lower scores to research proposals that are closer to their own areas of expertise and to those that are highly novel. The patterns are consistent with biases associated with boundedly rational evaluation of new ideas. The patterns are inconsistent with intellectual distance simply contributing “noise” or being associated with private interests of evaluators. We discuss implications for policy, managerial intervention, and allocation of resources in the ongoing accumulation of scientific knowledge.\n            This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.",

      "abstractNote": "Based on the crafting of seven fictional stories, the making of academic subjects in universities in times of neoliberal ethos is examined. The simultaneous configuration of subjects and objects of research is grasped in the term research(ing) subjects. Neoliberal governing generates the affect of anxiety as a socially manufactured intensity connected to precarity. We claim that the power effects of neoliberal configurations through the affect of anxiety is a particular governing strategy of subjectivation, and that its effects in making both researching and research subjects direct toward an economic logic where the self of academics and their work is shaped as insufficient. Putting the gaze on research(ing) subjects and anxiety is a way to disclosing the public secret of governing through affect and thus reimagining possibilities for resistance and meaningful academic work.",

      "abstractNote": "This document provides learnings from 13 case studies on governance mechanisms of national and supranational science, technology and innovation initiatives. As countries strive to resolve societal challenges, “mission-oriented” approaches complement traditional ones centred on national competitiveness, specific industrial sectors or technologies. Governance settings contribute overall to a more inclusive, transparent and responsible STI system, in particular through a whole-of-government approach, the consultation of academia, the private sector and civil society, the implementation of strategies by professional agencies, and the increasingly common use of evaluation. Several critical dimensions facilitate the success of STI policies. They include a commitment at the highest level of government, strong public-private collaboration in R&D, continuous evaluation and improvement, a “mission-oriented” approach, coherence of policies and flexibility in setting priorities, as well as overall harmonisation and rationalisation of programmes in order to maximise efficiency and reduce duplication.",

      "abstractNote": "L’institution imaginaire de la sociétéCritique sans concession de la « pensée héritée » sur la politique, la société et l’histoire, en particulier dans sa version marxiste, ce livre inclassable s’est affirmé comme une des œuvres majeures de la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, au carrefour de la politique, de la philosophie, de la psychanalyse et de la réflexion sur la science. Partant de la reconnaissance du rôle des significations imaginaires dans la création de notre monde, l’auteur y défend le projet d’une auto-institution explicite de la société. Cornelius Castoriadis (1922-1997) Co-fondateur du groupe et de la revue Socialisme ou Barbarie, ses écrits de cette période sont réédités depuis 2012 aux Éditions du Sandre. Il a été économiste à l’OCDE (1948-1970), psychanalyste (1973-1997), directeur d’études à l’EHESS (1980-1995). Ses séminaires font l’objet d’une publication posthume au Seuil, où ont été publiés six volumes des Carrefours du labyrinthe.",

      "abstractNote": "There is an increasing pressure on scholars to publish to further or sustain a career in academia. Governments and funding agencies are greedy of indicators based on scientific production to measure science output. But what exactly do we know about the relation between publication levels and advances in science? How do social dynamics and norms interfere with the quality of the scientific production? Are there different regimes of scientific dynamics? The present study proposes some concepts to think about scientific dynamics, through the modeling of the relation between science policies and scholars’ exploration–exploitation dilemmas. Passing, we analyze in detail the effects of the “publish or perish” policy, that turns out to have no significant effects in the developments of emerging scientific fields, while having detrimental impacts on the quality of the production of mature fields.",

      "abstractNote": "A few billion years have passed since the first life forms appeared. Since then, life has continued to forge complex associations between the different emergent levels of interconnection it forms. The advances of recent decades in molecular chemistry and theoretical biology, which have embraced complex systems approaches, now make it possible to conceptualize the questions of the origins of life and its increasing complexity from three complementary notions of closure: processes closure, autocatalytic closure and constraints closure. Developed in the wake of the second-order cybernetics, this triple closure approach, that relies on graph theory and complex networks science, sketch a paradigm where it is possible to go up the physical levels of organization of matter, from physics to biology and society, without resorting to strong reductionism. The phenomenon of life is conceived as the contingent complexification of the organization of matter, until the emergence of life forms, defined as a network of auto-catalytic process networks, organized in a multi-level manner. This approach of living systems, initiated by Maturana & Varela and Kauffman, inevitably leads to a reflection on the nature of cognition; and in the face of the deep changes that affected humanity as a complex systems, on the nature of cultural evolution. Faced with the major challenges that humanity will have to address in the decades to come, this new paradigm invites us to change our conception of causality by shifting our attention from state change to process change and to abandon a widespread notion of 'local' causality in favour of complex systems thinking. It also highlights the importance of a better understanding of the influence of social networks, recommendation systems and artificial intelligence on our future collective dynamics and social cognition processes.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Unifying the essential concepts of biological networks: biological insights and philosophical foundations’.",

      "abstractNote": "Significance\n            The size of scientific fields may impede the rise of new ideas. Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion. These findings suggest fundamental progress may be stymied if quantitative growth of scientific endeavors—in number of scientists, institutes, and papers—is not balanced by structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas.\n          , \n            In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.",

      "abstractNote": "The oracle at Delphi posed a question concerning a boat: If, in time, every plank has rotted and been replaced, is the boat the same boat? Yes, the owner will say, the vessel is not its planks but the relationship between them. Similarly, Antoine Danchin argues in this provocative book, life itself is not revealed just by its components--DNA, ribosomes, genes, cells--but also by their relationships. By the end of 2001, almost 500 genome programs were completed or under way. Drawing upon what researchers worldwide are learning from the gene sequences of bacteria, plants, fungi, fruit flies, worms, and humans, Danchin shows us how genomes are far more than mere collections of genes. They are the means of transmitting the system of relationships making up a living cell from one generation to the next. Genomes are codes that govern the construction, operation, and survival of cells. The Delphic Boat shows us that life is both a complicated piece of chemical machinery that decodes genomes and a process that builds this machinery. The laws of physics or chemistry can only predict so much of this process. To truly understand life, we must understand spatial and temporal relationships between molecules that make up the cell, and how these molecules are coordinated. Danchin persuades us that if we can reach this level of understanding of genomes, we will be able to resolve the major biological puzzle of the twenty-first century: the enigma of the living machine that creates the living machine.",

      "abstractNote": "Physiology and evolutionary biology have developed as two separated disciplines, a separation that mirrored the hypothesis that the physiological and evolutionary processes could be decoupled. We argue that non-genetic inheritance shatters the frontier between physiology and evolution, and leads to the coupling of physiological and evolutionary processes to a point where there exists a continuum between accommodation by phenotypic plasticity and adaptation by natural selection. This approach is also profoundly affecting the definition of the concept of phenotypic plasticity, which should now be envisaged as a multi-scale concept. We further suggest that inclusive inheritance provides a quantitative way to help bridging infra-individual (i.e. physiology) with supra-individual (i.e. evolution) approaches, in a way that should help building the long sough inclusive evolutionary synthesis.",

      "abstractNote": "After decades of debate about the existence of non-genetic inheritance, the focus is now slowly shifting towards dissecting its underlying mechanisms. Here, we propose a new mechanism that, by integrating non-genetic and genetic inheritance, may help build the long-sought inclusive vision of evolution. After briefly reviewing the wealth of evidence documenting the existence and ubiquity of non-genetic inheritance in a table, we review the categories of mechanisms of parent–offspring resemblance that underlie inheritance. We then review several lines of argument for the existence of interactions between non-genetic and genetic components of inheritance, leading to a discussion of the contrasting timescales of action of non-genetic and genetic inheritance. This raises the question of how the fidelity of the inheritance system can match the rate of environmental variation. This question is central to understanding the role of different inheritance systems in evolution. We then review and interpret evidence indicating the existence of shifts from inheritance systems with low to higher transmission fidelity. Based on results from different research fields we propose a conceptual hypothesis linking genetic and non-genetic inheritance systems. According to this hypothesis, over the course of generations, shifts among information systems allow gradual matching between the rate of environmental change and the inheritance fidelity of the corresponding response. A striking conclusion from our review is that documented shifts between types of inherited non-genetic information converge towards epigenetics (i.e. inclusively heritable molecular variation in gene expression without change in DNA sequence). We then interpret the well-documented mutagenicity of epigenetic marks as potentially generating a final shift from epigenetic to genetic encoding. This sequence of shifts suggests the existence of a relay in inheritance systems from relatively labile ones to gradually more persistent modes of inheritance, a relay that could constitute a new mechanistic basis for the long-proposed, but still poorly documented, hypothesis of genetic assimilation. A profound difference between the genocentric and the inclusive vision of heredity revealed by the genetic assimilation relay proposed here lies in the fact that a given form of inheritance can affect the rate of change of other inheritance systems. To explore the consequences of such inter-connection among inheritance systems, we briefly review published theoretical models to build a model of genetic assimilation focusing on the shift in the engraving of environmentally induced phenotypic variation into the DNA sequence. According to this hypothesis, when environmental change remains stable over a sufficient number of generations, the relay among inheritance systems has the potential to generate a form of genetic assimilation. In this hypothesis, epigenetics appears as a hub by which non-genetically inherited environmentally induced variation in traits can become genetically encoded over generations, in a form of epigenetically facilitated mutational assimilation. Finally, we illustrate some of the major implications of our hypothetical framework, concerning mutation randomness, the central dogma of molecular biology, concepts of inheritance and the curing of inherited disorders, as well as for the emergence of the inclusive evolutionary synthesis.",

      "abstractNote": "Frequently during evolution, new phenotypes evolved due to novelty in gene regulation, such as that caused by genome rewiring. This has been demonstrated by comparing common regulatory sequences among species and by identifying single regulatory mutations that are associated with new phenotypes. However, while a single mutation changes a single element, gene regulation is accomplished by a regulatory network involving multiple interactive elements. Therefore, to better understand regulatory evolution, we have studied how mutations contributed to the adaptation of cells to a regulatory challenge. We created a synthetic genome rewiring in yeast cells, challenged their gene regulation, and studied their adaptation. HIS3, an essential enzyme for histidine biosynthesis, was placed exclusively under a GAL promoter, which is induced by galactose and strongly repressed in glucose. Such rewired cells were faced with significant regulatory challenges in a repressive glucose medium. We identified several independent mutations in elements of the GAL system associated with the rapid adaptation of cells, such as the repressor GAL80 and the binding sites of the activator GAL4. Consistent with the extraordinarily high rate of cell adaptation, new regulation emerged during adaptation via multiple trajectories, including those involving mutations in elements of the GAL system. The new regulation of HIS3 tuned its expression according to histidine requirements with or without these significant mutations, indicating that additional factors participated in this regulation and that the regulatory network could reorganize in multiple ways to accommodate different mutations. This study, therefore, stresses network plasticity as an important property for regulatory adaptation and evolution.",

      "abstractNote": "Much contemporary biology consists of identifying the molecular components that associate to perform biological functions, then discovering how these functions are controlled. The concept of control is key to biological understanding, at least of the physiological kind; identifying regulators of processes underpins ideas of causality and allows complicated, multicomponent systems to be summarized in relatively simple diagrams and models. Unfortunately, as this article demonstrates by drawing on published articles, there is a growing tendency for authors to claim that a molecule is a ‘regulator’ of something on evidence that cannot support the conclusion. In particular, gene knockout experiments, which can demonstrate only that a molecule is necessary for a process, are all too frequently being misinterpreted as revealing regulation. This logical error threatens to blur the important distinction between regulation and mere necessity and therefore to weaken one of our strongest tools for comprehending how organisms work.",

      "abstractNote": "Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life.In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.This 30th anniversary edition of Dawkins' fascinating book retains all original material, including the two enlightening chapters added in the second edition. In a new Introduction the author presents his thoughts thirty years after the publication of his first and most famous book, while the inclusion of the two-page original Foreword by brilliant American scientist Robert Trivers shows the enthusiastic reaction of the scientific community at that time. This edition is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary thought, a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights, and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today.Review\"Dawkins first book, The Selfish Gene, was a smash hit...Best of all, Dawkins laid out this biology-some of it truly subtle-in stunningly lucid prose. (It is, in my view, the best work of popular science ever written.)\"--New York Review of Books\"This important book could hardly be more exciting.\"--The Economist\"The sort of popular science writing that makes the reader feel like a genius.\"--New York Times\"Who should read this book? Everyone interested in the universe and their place in it.\"--Jeffrey R. Baylis, Animal Behaviour\"This book should be read, can be read, by almost everyone. It describes with great skill a new face of the theory of evolution.\"--W. D. Hamilton, Science\"The presentations are remarkable for their clarity and simplicity, intelligible to any schoolchild, yet so little condescending as to be a pleasure to the professional.\"--American ScientistAbout the AuthorRichard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal Society of Literature, and an international lecturer. His acclaimed books include The Extended Phenotype, a more technical sequel to The Selfish Gene, and The Blind Watchmaker, which won the Royal Society of Literature Award and the Los Angeles Times Prize, both in 1987. His other bestsellers include River out of Eden, Climbing Mount Impossible, Unweaving the Rainbow, and the A Devil's Chaplain. His most recent book is The Ancestor's Tale.Professor Dawkins is the recipient of many prizes and honors, including the Shakespeare Prize, the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Royal Society's Michael Faraday Award, the Nakayama Prize for Achievement in Human Science, The International Cosmos Prize, and the Kistler Prize.",

      "abstractNote": "Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself. Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper locates the discussion around the finalization thesis in a broader science policy context, linking it to the recent discourse on a changing science-society contract. It is argued that the broadening of the Kuhnian concept of the paradigm, making it amenable to science policy studies, was an important move. Further development of this notion, however, standed on the prongs of critique coming from both the worlds of politics and science. At the same time, advances in the cognitive sociology of science undermined the internalist/externalist distinction. Today, with certain changes in the conditions of research due to the introduction of the concept of ?strategic research?, politicians are more apt to accept certain points of the thesis; scientific communities, on the other hand, perceive new threats to their autonomy. This paper tries to make sense of this new situation by translating the question of interplay between internal and external dynamics of research into one involving boundary management and epistemic criteria. The notion of ?epistemic drift? is introduced and the internalist/externalist distinction refurbished in neo-institutionalist terms, making use of the concept of interfoliating credibility cycles.",

      "abstractNote": "Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and simple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be fueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.",

      "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Morphogenetic movements are closely regulated by the expression of developmental genes. Here I examine whether developmental gene expression can in turn be mechanically regulated by morphogenetic movements. I have analyzed the effects of mechanical stress on the expression of Twist, which is normally expressed only in the most ventral cells of the cellular blastoderm embryo under the control of the Dorsal morphogen gradient. At embryogenesis gastrulation (stage 7), Twist is also expressed in the anterior foregut and stomodeal primordia.\nRESULTS: Submitting the early Drosophila embryo to a transient 10% uniaxial lateral deformation induces the ectopic expression of Twist around the entire dorsal-ventral axis and results in the ventralization of the embryo. This induction is independent of the Dorsal gradient and is triggered by mechanically induced Armadillo nuclear translocation. I also show that Twist is not expressed in the anterior foregut and stomodeal primordia at stage 7 in mutants that block the morphogenetic movement of germ-band extension. Because I can rescue the mutants with gentle compression of these cells, my interpretation is that the stomodeal-cell compression normally caused by the germ-band extension induces the expression of Twist. Correspondingly, laser ablation of dorsal cells in wild-type embryos relaxes stomodeal cell compression and reduces Twist expression in the stomodeal primordium. I also demonstrate that the induction of Twist in these cells depends on the nuclear translocation of Armadillo.\nCONCLUSIONS: I propose that anterior-gut formation is mechanically induced by the movement of germ-band extension through the induction of Twist expression in stomodeal cells.",

      "abstractNote": "Background The academic publishing world is changing significantly, with ever-growing numbers of publications each year and shifting publishing patterns. However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart’s Law, according to which, “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Results In this study, we analyzed >120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal’s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.",

      "abstractNote": "Michael Polanyi spent his long career thinking and writing about the workings of science and the scientific community. Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay, ‘The Republic of Science’. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the tacit dimension in knowledge formation—or what he described as ‘personal knowledge’. On the one hand, his political essay supports a classical conservative position, while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's own ‘fiduciary community’—in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Society—shaped his theoretical conceptualization of the so-called ‘republic of science’. In this way, Polanyi's political contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political thought.",

      "abstractNote": "Organicism (materialistic holism) has provided the philosophical underpinnings for embryology since the time of Kant. It had influenced the founders of developmental mechanics, and the importance of organicism to embryology was explicitly recognized by such figures as O. Hertwig, H. Spemann, R. Harrison, A. M. Dalq, J. Needham, and C. H. Waddington. Many of the principles of organicism remain in contemporary developmental biology, but they are rarely defined as such. A combination of genetic reductionism and the adoption of holism by unscientific communities has led to the devaluation of organicism as a fruitful heuristic for research. This essay attempts to define organicism, provide a brief history of its importance to experimental embryology, outline some sociologically based reasons for its decline, and document its value in contemporary developmental biology. Based on principles or organicism, developmental biology should become a science of emerging complexity. However, this does mean that some of us will have to learn calculus. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

      "abstractNote": "Le vivant critique et chaotique fut le titre de l’école de printemps 2014 de la Société francophone de biologie théorique (SFBT) qui a eu pour motivation d’attirer plus particulièrement la communauté des physiciens, avec pour argumentaire de « transposer les outils d’analyse des systèmes dynamiques hors équilibre, transitoires, critiques et chaotiques utilisés pour décrire la matière inerte au contexte du vivant ». Dans le présent ouvrage, l’objectif a été d’aller au-delà des analyses de stabilité classiques des systèmes de réaction-diffusion pour analyser de façon plus approfondie la dynamique du vivant qui, loin d’être un monde calme et organisé, est en réalité un monde bouleversé avec des régimes le plus souvent métastables ou critiques, voire chaotiques. Ces phénomènes de transition et de bifurcation sont très étudiés en physique et mathématiques et il apparaît opportun de les appliquer à l’analyse des systèmes dynamiques du vivant pour en révéler et en explorer toute la complexité qui reste le plus souvent ignorée. Ce thème du vivant critique et chaotique, laissé à la libre interprétation des auteurs, a été abordé de façons très diverses allant de l’épistémologie à l’aide au diagnostic. Les neuf chapitres qui composent ce livre recouvrent ainsi plusieurs champs disciplinaires incluant les mathématiques, la physique, l’informatique, la biologie, la physiologie et la médecine et de nombreuses applications qui concernent entre autres l’épidémiologie, l’électro- et la neurophysiologie, la signalisation et l’agrégation cellulaire et le système immunitaire. Tous les chapitres proposent des approches ou des points de vue originaux qui se démarquent de ceux généralement admis. Ils contribuent à montrer l’effervescence intellectuelle qui continue d’agiter la biologie théorique et qui en fait un champ de recherche particulièrement stimulant. Le vivant critique et chaotique s’adresse à toute personne qui s’intéresse à la science en général, à l’évolution des sciences et de la biologie théorique en particulier.\n\nIntroduction.

      "abstractNote": "Since the 1950s, the concept of information has acquired astrikingly prominent role in many parts of biology. This enthusiasmextends far beyond domains where the concept might seem to have anobvious application, such as the biological study of perception,cognition, and language, and now reaches into the most basic parts ofbiological theory. Hormones and other cellular products through whichphysiological systems are regulated are typically described assignals.  Descriptions of how genes play their causal role inmetabolic processes and development are routinely given in terms of“transcription”, “translation”, and“editing”. The most general term used for the processes bywhich genes exert their effects is “gene expression”. Thefates of cells in a developing organism are explained in terms oftheir processing of “positional information” given to themfrom surrounding cells and other factors. Many biologists think of thedevelopmental processes by which organisms progress from egg to adultin terms of the execution of a “developmentalprogram”. Other biologists have argued for a pivotal role forinformation in evolution rather than development: John Maynard Smithand Eors Szathmáry (for example) suggest that major transitions inevolution depend on expansions in the amount and accuracy with whichinformation is transmitted across generations. And some have arguedthat we can only understand the evolutionary role of genes byrecognizing an informational “domain” that existsalongside the domain of matter and energy. , Both philosophers and biologists have contributed to an ongoingfoundational discussion of the status of this mode of description inbiology. It is generally agreed that the sense of information isolatedby Claude Shannon and used in mathematical information theory islegitimate, useful, and relevant in many parts of biology. In thissense, anything is a source of information if it has a rangeof possible states, and one variable carries informationabout another to the extent that their states are physicallycorrelated. But it is also agreed that many uses of informationallanguage in biology seem to make use of a richer and more problematicconcept than Shannon’s. Some have drawn onthe teleosemantic tradition in philosophy of mind to makesense of this richer concept.  Other theorists have countered that Shannon’s correlational conception of information is richer than it looks., A minority tradition has argued that the enthusiasm for informationin biology has been a serious theoretical wrong turn, and that itfosters naive genetic determinism, other distortions of ourunderstanding of the roles of interacting causes, or an implicitlydualist ontology. However, this sceptical response is fading, with keysceptics coming to accept a modest but genuine role for informationalconcepts in the life sciences. Others have taken the critique seriously buttried to distinguish legitimate appeals to information from misleadingor erroneous ones.",

      "abstractNote": "Today, research, particularly basic research, is relatively absent from the vocabulary of governments and industry compared to the 1960s and 1970s. Research is discussed, if at all, as part of the rhetoric on technological innovation. In many respects, research has disappeared as an autonomous object. This chapter documents a key moment in history, in that it was an occurrence responsible for the marginalization of research in scholarly and public discourses. Beginning in the 1960s, a diversity of scholars and practitioners began to question the role of research in contributing to socio-economic progress. They did so by choosing innovation as a key concept. Innovation in this view is a social or holistic process that includes far more than research. In this chapter, I give social existence to a discourse of the 1960s and 1970s, now forgotten but emblematic in the intervening decades, that marginalized research as a perceived source of socio-economic progress.",

      "abstractNote": "Lost in the raging debate over the validity of social construction is the question of what, precisely, is being constructed. Facts, gender, quarks, reality? Is it a person? An object? An idea? A theory? Each entails a different notion of social construction, Ian Hacking reminds us. His book explores an array of examples to reveal the deep issues underlying contentious accounts of reality.Especially troublesome in this dispute is the status of the natural sciences, and this is where Hacking finds some of his most telling cases, from the conflict between biological and social approaches to mental illness to vying accounts of current research in sedimentary geology. He looks at the issue of child abuse--very much a reality, though the idea of child abuse is a social product. He also cautiously examines the ways in which advanced research on new weapons influences not the content but the form of science. In conclusion, Hacking comments on the \"culture wars\" in anthropology, in particular a spat between leading ethnographers over Hawaii and Captain Cook. Written with generosity and gentle wit by one of our most distinguished philosophers of science, this wise book brings a much needed measure of clarity to current arguments about the nature of knowledge.",

      "abstractNote": "A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for interactions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the \"tumor microenvironment.\" Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.",

      "abstractNote": "Modern biology, especially biomedical research, is currently embroiled in crisis. This crisis is not unsurprising considering the bourgeois culture and philosophy that has guided scientific research since the Molecular Biology revolution and aided by the increasing public-private partnerships. The resolution of this crisis can only be achieved through a radical shift in how we understand and practice science, and the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism can provide us with the necessary tools to do so. In this paper, I provide a brief overview of the development of dialectical materialism and its application over the years to understanding the natural world. I also show that biologists have also independently adopted similar views as research has progressed over the years. Lastly, I argue that the epistemological crisis and the subsequent crisis observed in the practice in science are two sides of the same coin, and that Marxist philosophy can help break out of this vicious cycle.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper investigates how competition to publish ﬁrst and thereby establish priority impacts the quality of scientiﬁc research. We begin by developing a model where scientists decide whether and how long to work on a given project. When deciding how long to let their projects mature, scientists trade oﬀ the marginal beneﬁt of higher quality research against the marginal risk of being pre-empted. The most important (highest potential) projects are the most competitive because they induce the most entry. Therefore, the model predicts these projects are also the most rushed and lowest quality. We test the predictions of this model in the ﬁeld of structural biology using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for structures of large macromolecules. An important feature of the PDB is that it assigns objective measures of scientiﬁc quality to each structure. As suggested by the model, we ﬁnd that structures with higher ex-ante potential generate more competition, are completed faster, and are lower quality. Consistent with the model, and with a causal interpretation of our empirical results, these relationships are mitigated when we focus on structures deposited by scientists who – by nature of their employment position – are less focused on publication and priority.",

      "abstractNote": "As shown by Hofmeyr, the processes in the living cell can be divided into three classes of efficient causes that produce each other, so making the cell closed to efficient causation, the hallmark of an organism. They are the enzyme catalysts of covalent metabolic chemistry, the intracellular milieu that drives the supramolecular processes of chaperone-assisted folding and self-assembly of polypeptides and nucleic acids into functional catalysts and transporters, and the membrane transporters that maintain the intracellular milieu, in particular its electrolyte composition. Each class of efficient cause can be modelled as a relational diagram in the form of a mapping in graph-theoretic form, and a minimal model of a self-manufacturing system that is closed to efficient causation can be constructed from these three mappings using the formalism of relational biology. This fabrication-assembly or (F,A)-system serves as an alternative to Robert Rosen’s replicative metabolism-repair or (M,R)-system, which has been notoriously problematic to realise in terms of real biochemical processes. A key feature of the model is the explicit incorporation of formal cause, which arrests the infinite regress that plagues all relational models of the cell. The (F,A)-system is extended into a detailed relational model of the self-manufacturing cell that has a clear biochemical realisation. This (F,A) cell model allows the interpretation and visualisation of concepts such as the metabolism and repair components of Rosen’s (M,R)-system, John von Neumann’s universal constructor, Howard Pattee’s symbol-function split via the symbol-folding transformation, Marcello Barbieri’s genotype–ribotype–phenotype ontology, and Tibor Gánti’s chemoton.",

      "abstractNote": "A chemical mixture that continually absorbs work from its environment may exhibit steady-state chemical concentrations that deviate from their equilibrium values. Such behavior is particularly interesting in a scenario where the environmental work sources are relatively difficult to access, so that only the proper orchestration of many distinct catalytic actors can power the dissipative flux required to maintain a stable, far-from-equilibrium steady state. In this article, we study the dynamics of an in silico chemical network with random connectivity in an environment that makes strong thermodynamic forcing available only to rare combinations of chemical concentrations. We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing.",

However, because molecular biologists habitually assume uniformity of the cell populations that serve as starting material for experimental analysis, attention to such non-genetic heterogeneity has been scant. As awareness of, and interest in, understanding its biological significance increases, this Primer attempts to clarify the confusing terminologies used in an emerging field that often conflates heterogeneity with noise, and provides a qualitative introduction to the fundamental dynamic principles that underlie heterogeneity. It thus aims to present a useful conceptual framework to organize, analyze and communicate observations made at the resolution of individual cells that indicate that heterogeneity of cell populations plays a biological role, such as in multipotency and cell fate decision.",

      "abstractNote": "For several decades now a set of researches from a wide range of different sectors has been developed which goes by the name of “science of complexity” and is opposed point by point to the paradigm of classical science. It challenges the idea that world is “simple.” To the reductionist idea that each process is the sum of the actions of its components it opposes a holistic view (the whole is more than the sum of the parts). The aim of the present article is to analyze the epistemological status attributed in the science of complexity to several fundamental ideas, such as those of scientific law, objectivity, and prediction. The aim is to show that the hope of superseding reductionism by means of concepts such as that of “emergence” is fallacious and that the science of complexity proposes forms of reductionism that are even more restrictive than the classical ones, particularly when it claims to unify in a single treatment problems that vary widely in nature such as physical, biological, and social problems.",

We start by examining the basic concepts of the field and the mechanisms that underlie epigenetic inheritance. We present a comprehensive review of transgenerational cellular epigenetic inheritance among different taxa in the form of a table, and discuss the data contained therein. The analysis of these data shows that epigenetic inheritance is ubiquitous and suggests lines of research that go beyond present approaches to the subject. We conclude by exploring some of the consequences of epigenetic inheritance for the study of evolution, while also pointing to the importance of recognizing and understanding epigenetic inheritance for practical and theoretical issues in biology.",

      "abstractNote": "At first sight, the empirical study of ontogenesis and the theoretical study of organismal agency seem to have little in common. In this chapter, we discuss why this initial impression is incorrect. First of all, ontogenesis and agency are indirectly connected at the level of the whole organism, since they are co-dependent on the peculiar organization that characterizes living systems. While ontogenesis is constrained by its own requirement to maintain living organization in the form of organizational closure throughout the life cycle, agency is grounded in the same phenomenon of organizational continuity. Second, cellular agency contributes more directly to important processes of multicellular development in organisms with multiple levels of organization. This leads to a view of ontogenesis that emphasizes agency and variation in the underlying cellular dynamics, focusing on stability and reproducibility of ontogenetic processes as its main explanatory targets. We examine how these insights can help us bridge the explanatory gap between reductionist mechanistic empirical approaches and theoretical considerations of the organization of the whole organism. We conclude that both approaches are best used in a complementary manner. Only by contextualizing ontogenetic mechanisms in the larger context of the evolving life cycle, will we gain a true understanding of their functionality and evolution.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent studies of active matter have stimulated interest in the driven self-assembly of complex structures. Phenomenological modeling of particular examples has yielded insight, but general thermodynamic principles unifying the rich diversity of behaviors observed have been elusive. Here, we study the stochastic search of a toy chemical space by a collection of reacting Brownian particles subject to periodic forcing. We observe the emergence of an adaptive resonance in the system matched to the drive frequency, and show that the increased work absorption by these resonant structures is key to their stabilization. Our findings are consistent with a recently proposed thermodynamic mechanism for far-from-equilibrium self-organization.",

      "abstractNote": "Substantial grounds exist to doubt the universal validity of the Newtonian Paradigm that requires a pre-stated, fixed phase space. Therefore, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, stated only for fixed phase spaces, is also in doubt. The validity of the Newtonian Paradigm may stop at the onset of evolving life. Living cells and organisms are Kantian Wholes that achieve constraint closure, so do thermodynamic work to construct themselves. Evolution constructs an ever-expanding phase space. Thus, we can ask the free energy cost per added degree of freedom. That cost is roughly linear or sublinear in the mass constructed. However, the resulting expansion of the phase space is exponential or even hyperbolic. Thus, the evolving biosphere does thermodynamic work to construct itself into an ever-smaller sub-domain of its ever-expanding phase space at ever less free energy cost per added degree of freedom. The universe is not correspondingly disordered. Entropy, remarkably, really does decrease. A testable implication of this, termed here the Fourth Law of Thermodynamics, is that at constant energy input, the biosphere will construct itself into an ever more localized subregion of its ever-expanding phase space. This is confirmed. The energy input from the sun has been roughly constant for the 4 billion years since life started to evolve. The localization of our current biosphere in its protein phase space is at least 10–2540. The localization of our biosphere with respect to all possible molecules of CHNOPS comprised of up to 350,000 atoms is also extremely high. The universe has not been correspondingly disordered. Entropy has decreased. The universality of the Second Law fails.",

      "abstractNote": "The recent discussion on scientific representation has focused on models and their relationship to the real world. It has been assumed that models give us knowledge because they represent their supposed real target systems. However, here agreement among philosophers of science has tended to end as they have presented widely different views on how representation should be understood. I will argue that the traditional representational approach is too limiting as regards the epistemic value of modelling given the focus on the relationship between a single model and its supposed target system, and the neglect of the actual representational means with which scientists construct models. I therefore suggest an alternative account of models as epistemic tools. This amounts to regarding them as concrete artefacts that are built by specific representational means and are constrained by their design in such a way that they facilitate the study of certain scientific questions, and learning from them by means of construction and manipulation.",

      "abstractNote": "Shannon information theory provides various measures of so-called syntactic information, which reflect the amount of statistical correlation between systems. By contrast, the concept of ‘semantic information’ refers to those correlations which carry significance or ‘meaning’ for a given system. Semantic information plays an important role in many fields, including biology, cognitive science and philosophy, and there has been a long-standing interest in formulating a broadly applicable and formal theory of semantic information. In this paper, we introduce such a theory. We define semantic information as the syntactic information that a physical system has about its environment which is causally necessary for the system to maintain its own existence. ‘Causal necessity’ is defined in terms of counter-factual interventions which scramble correlations between the system and its environment, while ‘maintaining existence’ is defined in terms of the system's ability to keep itself in a low entropy state. We also use recent results in non-equilibrium statistical physics to analyse semantic information from a thermodynamic point of view. Our framework is grounded in the intrinsic dynamics of a system coupled to an environment, and is applicable to any physical system, living or otherwise. It leads to formal definitions of several concepts that have been intuitively understood to be related to semantic information, including ‘value of information’, ‘semantic content’ and ‘agency’.",

      "abstractNote": "Drawing on current biology, we argue that the phase space of economic evolution is not stable. Thus, there are no entailing laws of economic dynamics. In this sense, economic dynamics are creative and the economy is not a causal system. Because economic dynamics are creative, the implicit frame of analysis for the econosphere changes in unprestatable and non-algorithmic ways. New-venture, social, and political entrepreneurs solve the frame problem of the econosphere. Economic evolution is unpredictable, not entailed, and the number of things traded (‘cambiodiversity’) increases over time. Our metatheoretic framework points out how institutions, entrepreneurs, and disparate actors enable what we call ‘novelty intermediation’. We provide examples of novelty intermediation from Rennaissance Italy to Silicon Valley. Our framework does not automatically provide clear policy prescriptions in part because our main result is negative. It may nevertheless provide a useful prolegomenon to a future economics ﬁt for a creative world.",

      "abstractNote": "An oracle that correctly predicts the outcome of every particle physics experiment, the products of every possible chemical reaction or the function of every protein would revolutionize science and technology. However, scientists would not be entirely satisfied because they would want to comprehend how the oracle made these predictions. This is scientific understanding, one of the main aims of science. With the increase in the available computational power and advances in artificial intelligence, a natural question arises: how can advanced computational systems, and specifically artificial intelligence, contribute to new scientific understanding or gain it autonomously? Trying to answer this question, we adopted a definition of ‘scientific understanding’ from the philosophy of science that enabled us to overview the scattered literature on the topic and, combined with dozens of anecdotes from scientists, map out three dimensions of computer-assisted scientific understanding. For each dimension, we review the existing state of the art and discuss future developments. We hope that this Perspective will inspire and focus research directions in this multidisciplinary emerging field.",

      "abstractNote": "It is now widely recognized that gene expression and cellular processes include a probabilistic component. However, this does not essentially modify the theory of genetic programming. This stochastic aspect, which is called noise, is usually conceived as a margin of fluctuation in the way the genetic program functions and the latter remains understood as a specific mechanism guided by genetic information. In contrast, recent data show that proteins do not possess a high level of specificity. They can interact with numerous molecular partners. As a consequence molecular interactions are not simply “noisy”. Because they are subject to large combinatorial interaction possibilities, they are also intrinsically stochastic and must be sorted out by the cell structure. This contradicts the genetic programming theory which is based on the idea that protein interactions are directed by their stereospecificity and genetic information. Taking into account the lack of protein specificity leads to a new theory. Natural selection acts not only in evolution but also in ontogenesis by sorting stochastic molecular interactions. In this frame, the making up of an organism, instead of being a simple bottom-top process in which information flows from genes to phenotypes, is both a bottom-top and top-bottom process. Genes provide proteins, but their stochastic interactions are sorted by selective constraints arising from the cell and multi-cellular structures, which are themselves subject to the action of natural selection.",

      "abstractNote": "A probabilistic theory for cell differentiation is proposed in which it is postulated that differential gene expression is provoked by random events. An analysis of determinist theories is made, and two predictions based on the probabilistic theory are compared to experimental fact. A probabilistic model of gene regulation is also given. This theory can account for several phenomena: differential gene expression, embryonic mortality, DNA C-value paradox; and it does not need t refer to a wide diversity of specific regulators.",

      "abstractNote": "This article presents a model of the research and publication process that analyzes why scientists commit fraud and how fraud can be detected and prevented. In the model, authors are asymmetrically informed about the success of their projects and can fraudulently manipulate their results. We show, first, that the types of scientific frauds that are observed are unlikely to be representative of the overall amount of malfeasance; also, star scientists are more likely to misbehave but less likely to be caught than average scientists. Second, a reduction in fraud verification costs may not lead to a reduction of misconduct episodes but rather to a change in the type of research that is performed. Third, a strong “publish or perish” pressure may reduce, and not increase, scientific misconduct because it motivates more scrutiny. Finally, a more active role of editors in checking for misconduct does not always provide additional deterrence.",

      "abstractNote": "Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.",

evolutionary theory is vastly more sophisticated than the original synthesis and covers a broader range of phenomena. However, while such progress is undeniable, it does not imply that the underlying conceptual framework allows evolutionary biologists to make the most out of progress in biology and other fields. For instance, some more implicit features of contemporary evolutionary thought, such as the assignment of causal and informational privileges to genes in development, or the treating of development and heredity as separate phenomena, remain prevalent in spite of new data that appear to challenge these assumptions</span> <span class=\"citation\"

      "abstractNote": "Modern natural history serves a federation of disciplines, and as such falls into a “meta-science” of the diversity and history of objects, which makes it into a discipline following the institutional sense of the word. Natural history and evolution biology of the twentieth century have not completely removed idealism, where the dynamics of life are not fully understood because they are locked up into invariants, as if these latter would exist in the material world. Biology needed a principle of change to explain the evolution of species, but a principle of stability to explain the regularity in the structure and function of the body and its organs. The grade is a classification structure that designates a “degree of complexity”, and that, taken in an evolutionist context, proclaims the degree of complexity. The notion of a body plan is used in articles on developmental genetics.",

      "abstractNote": "Research on bias in peer review examines scholarly communication and funding processes to assess the epistemic and social legitimacy of the mechanisms by which knowledge communities vet and self-regulate their work. Despite vocal concerns, a closer look at the empirical and methodological limitations of research on bias raises questions about the existence and extent of many hypothesized forms of bias. In addition, the notion of bias is predicated on an implicit ideal that, once articulated, raises questions about the normative implications of research on bias in peer review. This review provides a brief description of the function, history, and scope of peer review; articulates and critiques the conception of bias unifying research on bias in peer review; characterizes and examines the empirical, methodological, and normative claims of bias in peer review research; and assesses possible alternatives to the status quo. We close by identifying ways to expand conceptions and studies of bias to contend with the complexity of social interactions among actors involved directly and indirectly in peer review.",

      "abstractNote": "Negative feedback is common in biological processes and can increase a system’s stability to internal and external perturbations. But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.",

The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.",

      "abstractNote": "Chronic dietary restriction (DR) is considered among the most robust life-extending interventions, but several reports indicate that DR does not always extend and may even shorten lifespan in some genotypes. An unbiased genetic screen of the lifespan response to DR has been lacking. Here we measured the effect of one commonly used level of dietary restriction (DR: 40% reduction in food intake) on mean lifespan of virgin males and females in 41 recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice. Mean strain-specific lifespan varied 2- to 3-fold under ad libitum (AL) feeding and 6- to 10-fold under DR, in males and females, respectively. Notably, DR shortened lifespan in more strains than those in which it lengthened life. Food intake and female fertility varied markedly among strains under AL feeding, but neither predicted DR survival: therefore, strains in which DR shortened lifespan did not have low food intake or poor reproductive potential. Finally, strain-specific lifespans under DR and AL feeding were not correlated, indicating that the genetic determinants of lifespan under these two conditions differ. These results demonstrate that the lifespan response to a single level of DR exhibits wide variation amenable to genetic analysis. They also show that DR can shorten lifespan in inbred mice. Although strains with shortened lifespan under 40% DR may not respond negatively under less stringent DR, the results raise the possibility that life extension by DR may not be universal.",

Domaine interdisciplinaire fondé par le Santa Fe Institute en 1984 aux États-Unis, il a été décrit par ses représentants comme un champ d’étude interdisciplinaire, post-laplacien, holiste et antiréductionniste. Des journalistes populaires et des sociologues intéressés et qui ont soutenu ce domaine en ont repris les discours, en annonçant l’avènement d’un nouveau paradigme révolutionnaire pour tous les savoirs. Dans ce texte, on montrera que le projet épistémique des sciences de la complexité est moins pluraliste, antipositiviste et antiréductionniste que ce que l’on en dit. Je tâcherai de montrer en quoi le cadre épistémologique et ontologique de ce champ d’études reste analytique et réductionniste dans un sens physicaliste, computationnaliste, mathématique et biologisant.",

      "abstractNote": "In the last century, jointly with the advent of computers, mathematical theories of information were developed. Shortly thereafter, during the ascent of molecular biology, the concept of information was rapidly transferred into biology at large. Several philosophers and biologists have argued against adopting this concept based on epistemological and ontological arguments, and also, because it encouraged genetic determinism. While the theories of elaboration and transmission of information are valid mathematical theories, their own logic and implicit causal structure make them inimical to biology, and because of it, their applications have and are hindering the development of a sound theory of organisms. Our analysis concentrates on the development of information theories in mathematics and on the differences between these theories regarding the relationship among complexity, information and entropy.",

This approach, in particular, focuses on the role of global entropy production and provides a tool for a mathematical understanding of some fundamental observations by Gould on the increasing phenotypic complexity along evolution. Lastly, we analyze the situation in terms of theoretical symmetries, in order to further specify the biological meaning of anti-entropy as well as its strong link with randomness.",

      "abstractNote": "Theories organize knowledge and construct objectivity by framing observations and experiments. The elaboration of theoretical principles is examined in the light of the rich interactions between physics and mathematics. These two disciplines share common principles of construction of concepts and of the proper objects of inquiry. Theory construction in physics relies on mathematical symmetries that preserve the key invariants observed and proposed by such theory; these invariants buttress the idea that the objects of physics are generic and thus interchangeable and they move along specific trajectories which are uniquely determined, in classical and relativistic physics., In contrast to physics, biology is a historical science that centers on the changes that organisms experience while undergoing ontogenesis and phylogenesis. Biological objects, namely organisms, are not generic but specific; they are individuals. The incessant changes they undergo represent the breaking of symmetries, and thus the opposite of symmetry conservation, a central component of physical theories. This instability corresponds to the changes of the environment and the phenotypes., Inspired by Galileo’s principle of inertia, the “default state” of inert matter, we propose a “default state” for biological dynamics following Darwin’s first principle, “descent with modification” that we transform into “proliferation with variation and motility” as a property that spans life, including cells in an organism. These dissimilarities between theories of the inert and of biology also apply to causality: biological causality is to be understood in relation to the distinctive role that constraints assume in this discipline. Consequently, the notion of cause will be reframed in a context where constraints to activity are seen as the core component of biological analyses. Finally, we assert that the radical materiality of life rules out distinctions such as “software vs. hardware.”",

      "abstractNote": "The dependence on history of both present and future dynamics of life is a common intuition in biology and in humanities. Historicity will be understood in terms of changes of the space of possibilities (or of “phase space”) as well as by the role of diversity in life’s structural stability and of rare events in history formation. We hint to a rigorous analysis of “path dependence” in terms of invariants and invariance preserving transformations, as it may be found also in physics, while departing from the physico-mathematical analyses. The idea is that the (relative or historicized) invariant traces of the past under organismal or ecosystemic transformations contribute to the understanding (or the “theoretical determination”) of present and future states of affairs. This yields a peculiar form of unpredictability (or randomness) in biology, at the core of novelty formation: the changes of observables and pertinent parameters may depend also on past events. In particular, in relation to the properties of synchronic measurement in physics, the relevance of diachronic measurement in biology is highlighted. This analysis may a fortiori apply to cognitive and historical human dynamics, while allowing to investigate some general properties of historicity in biology.",

      "abstractNote": "The modern theories of information opened to way to extraordinary new tools for communication and knowledge construction. When identified instead with the world (DNA is a complete information carrier and a program for ontogenesis, atomic particles and planets exchange information …), a new form of scientism affects knowledge and trust in science. Vague and implicit assumptions, with no precise references to the sciences of information, force strong consequences, in biology in particular. Similarly, the powerful optimization methods that make intelligible the dynamics of inert matter are expected or used to direct also human activities and replace human government by automatic governance. We are then meant to follow the formal, mechanical rule or the unique optimal path, instead of inventing new forms of sense in human interactions. Yet another fantastic tool, the newly available Big Data, is being considered to substitute scientific invention by correlations among numbers: fortunately, mathematics a priori shows that a deluge of spurious correlations may be found in any very large set of numbers. An ethics of knowledge may then be proposed in order to reconstruct the trust in science, as critical thinking at the heart of democracy.",

      "abstractNote": "Through the comparison between two major, long-lasting theoretical frameworks – geocentrism and genocentrism –we discuss the diﬀerent epistemological role played by metaphors in physics and biology. Throughout its history, physics developed theories and mathematical formalisms, which either do not seem to rely on metaphors at all (as geocentrism) or have absorbed initial thrusting metaphors into original theoretical frameworks. When considering genocentrism, in turn, the situation looks diﬀerent. For some authors, genocentric theories are not metaphorical, but for opposite reasons with respect to geocentrism: pivotal concepts of information theories are straightforwardly imported as theoretical ones into biology. For others, the reference to information in genocentrism is indeed metaphorical, although the similarities and dissimilarities are not spelt out. Some problematic consequences of the application of genocentrism to biology are discussed.",

In an accessible and elegant style, the authors present the successes and challenges of a new DNA-modifying technique: CRISPR. They transmit their emotions of discovery, passion for research, and intellectual audacity. While greatly admiring the technical skills of the authors, who are among the best researchers in the field, this review critically stresses the limits of their experimental practices, namely: a vague or incomplete theoretical frame; often unreachable genetic targets; off-target effects; prior failures to deliver by other forms of genetic manipulation, and, finally, the intrinsic unpredictability of many phenotypic consequences of such a powerful technique. Due to these concerns, the authors’ approach to organisms and Evolution is questioned with the purpose to generate an open debate.",

      "abstractNote": "The embryonic heart and vessels are dynamic and form and remodel while functional. Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a-/-). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood. These data show that hemodynamic force is necessary and sufficient to induce vessel remodeling in the mammalian yolk sac.",

      "abstractNote": "Policy makers around the world are calling for the production and diffusion of more useful information for environmental decision-making. Ideally, useful information expands alternatives, clariﬁes choice and enables policy makers to achieve desired outcomes. Decision makers, however, often lack the useful information needed for good decision-making. By concentrating efforts on increasing the supply of scientiﬁc information, scientists may not be producing information considered relevant and useful by decision makers, and may simply be producing too much of the wrong kind of information. Users may have speciﬁc information needs that go unmet, or may not be aware of the existence of potentially useful information. This paper deﬁnes the practical problem of reconciling the supply of scientiﬁc information with users’ demands so that scientists produce information that decision makers need and use in policy decisions. Literature from a variety of disciplines and topics is reviewed to: explain the goals of reconciling the supply and demand of scientiﬁc information; deﬁne what constitutes useful information; explore lessons learned from experience and describe the characteristics and conditioning factors that shaped those experiences; and identify various alternative strategies and processes that forge stronger science policy linkages. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "A number of factors have contributed to the crisis in higher education, including the long-term transformation in funding. In this article, I argue that neoliberalism can explain many of the processes leading to our changing commitment to colleges and universities and the cost increases that this change has produced. A number of neoliberal assumptions firmly rooted in conventional wisdom have contributed to a “student-as-customer” phenomenon, which is, itself, a cost driver. I look at the development of the student as customer as a vehicle for exploring tuition increases. I also examine the tension between education as a public and a private good and the marketization of higher education as crucial drivers of these transformations. In doing so, I emphasize that the student as customer has been created by the changes in the way we think about, organize, and fund education, rather than any fundamental change in young people.",

In this paper I examine the disinclination to treat the Neoliberal political project as a serious intellectual project motivating a series of successes in the public sphere.

      "abstractNote": "We propose a conceptual and formal characterisation of biological organisation as a closure of constraints. We ﬁrst establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in nonequilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.",

As discussed above, the central idea is that self-constraint occurs in biological systems in the form of closure, i.e. a causal regime in which a set of mutually dependent constraints act on the flows of energy and matter so as to collectively maintain themselves, and their organisation, over time. In turn, the fundamental formal distinction between the two regimes of causation at work (constraints and processes) relies on the identification of symmetries, and local conservations, at the relevant (temporal) scales.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FMAADTJ9N%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 25</span>)</span></p>\n</div>",

      "abstractNote": "Darwin introduced the concept that random variation generates new living forms. In this paper, we elaborate on Darwin’s notion of random variation to propose that biological variation should be given the status of a fundamental theoretical principle in biology. We state that biological objects such as organisms are speciﬁc objects. Speciﬁc objects are special in that they are qualitatively diﬀerent from each other. They can undergo unpredictable qualitative changes, some of which are not deﬁned before they happen. We express the principle of variation in terms of symmetry changes, where symmetries underlie the theoretical determination of the object. We contrast the biological situation with the physical situation, where objects are generic (that is, diﬀerent objects can be assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-deﬁned state spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of variation, in particular, biological objects show randomness, historicity and contextuality. We elaborate on the articulation between this principle and the two other principles proposed in this special issue: the principle of default state and the principle of organization.",

For example Boolean networks (see Kauffman, 1993) are used to model gene networks and are defined as random networks where the existence of an edge between two nodes follows a given probability distribution. Such an assumption is a way to model protein or gene networks in an ahistorical manner (and for example to generate them de novo in simulations).</span> <span class=\"citation\"

notion of constraint is central to our framework. Constraints are the building blocks of mathematical modeling in biology and are the main objects of experimental investigation. The theoretical notion of constraints that we propose should lead to a reinterpretation of mathematical models that are based on them. In our framework constraints depend on the rest of the organism and the rest of the organism depends on them (principle of organization). Moreover, constraints may undergo unpredictable variations (principle of variation).</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FAAVRKGPM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil et al., 2016, p. 17</span>)</span></p>\n</div>",

      "abstractNote": "In multicellular organisms, relations among parts and between parts and the whole are contextual and interdependent. These organisms and their cells are ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or computer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints. Implementing the mathematical model shows that constraints to the default state are sufficient to explain ductal and acinar formation, and points to a target of future research, namely, to inhibitors of cell proliferation and motility generated by the epithelial cells. The success of this model suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism could be examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist perspective we embrace.",

      "abstractNote": "We characterize access to empirical objects in biology from a theoretical perspective. Unlike objects in current physical theories, biological objects are the result of a history and their variations continue to generate a history. This property is the starting point of our concept of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is relative to a natural history which is shared by the different objects subjected to the measurement and is more or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to considering biological objects as equivalent in a measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by studying objects as similar as possible, while others build on biological diversity.",

If, say, inbred mice are fed milk from contaminated mice of another strain, then these mice will carry MMTV and transmit it to their descent. A contaminated female will lead to a substrain which is genetically identical to the original inbred strain (as long as the retrovirus does not alter mice DNA) but has critical immunological and oncologic differences.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 7</span>)</span> contamination with virus avoid epigenetic heredity</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%226FIQ2DRK%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ff6666%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B52.557%2C162.265%2C288.669%2C172.228%5D%2C%5B37.613%2C150.31%2C288.665%2C160.273%5D%2C%5B37.613%2C138.355%2C218.773%2C148.318%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">The context in which organisms and cells live before the experiment matters from the timescale of several generations to the timescales of development and physiology.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 7</span>)</span> % there are very nice examples such as position of feotus, experiments on rats and stress, anticipationn effects</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22W6XTGKPH%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B321.548%2C102.489%2C559.684%2C112.452%5D%2C%5B306.604%2C90.534%2C557.826%2C100.497%5D%2C%5B306.604%2C78.579%2C382.229%2C88.542%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">Filtering of individuals is a method to control strains: breeders disregard animals with deleterious mutations, diseases, or other peculiarities.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 7</span>)</span></p><p><img data-attachment-key=\"W4UH6773\" width=\"783\" height=\"315\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22WWLUR585%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66.618%2C597.919%2C536.471%2C787.184%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\"/><br/><span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 8</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22YQEIIBH2%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B192.375%2C495.491%2C289.928%2C505.454%5D%2C%5B37.613%2C483.536%2C200.791%2C493.499%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">For example, in humans, most methods above would be unethical.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 8</span>)</span> % what about in science ?

Is it part of closure ? not sure..</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22VKQW6Z5J%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B150.827%2C302.738%2C288.663%2C312.701%5D%2C%5B37.613%2C290.783%2C288.896%2C300.746%5D%2C%5B37.613%2C278.828%2C143.912%2C288.791%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">Working on the metabolic rate of mammals is more general than working on a single species by measuring wild specimens.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22PPJLCYJM%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B228.833%2C99.5%2C288.665%2C109.463%5D%2C%5B37.613%2C87.545%2C288.664%2C97.508%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">these strategies lose generality and alter the specimens in order to increase the</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%224J4BHDKD%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B306.604%2C748.068%2C445.996%2C758.031%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">reproducibility of the measurement.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F7XAXW3BI%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%228MWDTQGV%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ff6666%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B306.604%2C712.203%2C559.666%2C722.166%5D%2C%5B306.604%2C700.248%2C494.478%2C710.211%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">these strategies aim the genericization of biological organizations and use many methods to reduce diversity.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FNVDHTXQT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span> % making them generic objects like in physics.

For example, the force exerted on an object A in free fall is m−g → where −g → is the gravity field, and m is the mass of A. The analysis of free fall does not depend on the individual values of m—being real numbers most individual masses are ineffable—or on the nature of the object. Instead all possible m lead to the same analysis of trajectories. The genericity of the analysis is possible because physics is not about quantities.

These attempts use machine learning in combination with a few generic criteria that musical patterns are assumed to follow. The aim is to obtain a generic generator of acceptable soundtracks and thus to define and explore sets that have generic regularities that are assumed to be musically relevant. However, these generic regularities are not written in the algorithm, and they are not pre-stated (except for the generic criteria mentioned above). Instead, they are extracted by machine learning. Thus, the individual works of the musician rigorously preexist the definition of the generic properties extracted from machine learning and not the other way around. It follows that these generic sets are specific to the past of an individual composer or style and are subordinated to it. Moreover, assuming that there can be genuine qualitative novelties that result from probing these sets, there is no guaranty that they would be musically interesting.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 9</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F8MZW39MT%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%229RYIJYQZ%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B198.843%2C263.18%2C388.075%2C272.306%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C251.219%2C388.066%2C260.345%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C239.267%2C388.077%2C248.393%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C227.315%2C388.019%2C236.441%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C215.354%2C388.047%2C224.479%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C203.402%2C388.033%2C212.527%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C191.449%2C388.034%2C200.575%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C179.488%2C93.924%2C188.614%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%7D\">In physics (and epistemologically similar modeling approaches), the relevant properties are usually generic properties.

It is necessary to have written this text beforehand to choose initial conditions leading un to generate it.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 10</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F8MZW39MT%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22GSXLMSM7%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B285.737%2C422.067%2C388.047%2C431.193%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C410.115%2C388.076%2C419.241%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C398.163%2C388.045%2C407.289%5D%2C%5B50.744%2C386.202%2C370.64%2C395.328%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">we advocate a theoretical notion of possibilities, which we also call explicit possibilities, where possibilities are defined if and only if we define explicitly also how they “work”, that is to say how they take place in an appropriate theoretical framework where they have meaning.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F8MZW39MT%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22EE3GBH3T%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B212.36%2C337.502%2C388.069%2C347.512%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C326.425%2C388.045%2C335.551%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C314.473%2C388.021%2C323.599%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C302.521%2C388.076%2C311.647%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C290.56%2C388.035%2C299.685%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C277.724%2C388.034%2C287.734%5D%2C%5B50.743%2C265.772%2C388.054%2C275.782%5D%2C%5B50.743%2C254.695%2C388.056%2C263.821%5D%2C%5B50.743%2C241.859%2C388.064%2C251.869%5D%2C%5B50.743%2C230.791%2C361.922%2C239.917%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">The set of possible music scores has generic properties that are relevant for writing, writing software or printing. These operations are its natural theoretical context. Music scores are used to communicate symphonies as a writing system, which means that they are typically sufficient for constraining the receiver for her to interpret some music scores as symphonies. However, the theoretical construct used to define Ms is not sufficient for a sound theoretical understanding of symphonies themselves. This limitation is not just due to Ms lacking generic constructs. Instead, the meaning of musical possibilities lies at the individual level which means that musical sense is not a generic property. Thus, Ms may only be seen as a set of pre-possibilities for symphonies and not as a set of explicit possibilities.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2F8MZW39MT%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22L6UCQJ6I%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%235fb236%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.084%2C218.83%2C388.051%2C227.956%5D%2C%5B50.743%2C206.878%2C388.067%2C216.004%5D%2C%5B50.743%2C194.926%2C388.059%2C205.99%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C182.965%2C156.883%2C192.091%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">We call “pre-possibilities” sets whose meaning is not entirely explicit for the intended phenomena.

This objection requires a precise discussion. Let us call S(t) the possibility space at time t. If the observer witnesses a new possibility at time t′ &gt; t, then the possibility space S(t′) is larger than S(t). The operation that we have described in the previous paragraph is retrospectively to consider St′ (t), the space of possibility at time t on the basis of a novelty that appeared between t and t′. Bergson calls conflating St′ (t) and S(t) the retrospective illusion. This illusion may be compared with the situation in usual probabilities. Using the result of a random drawing to describe the initial condition makes it always possible to describe the process as deterministic which is clearly wrong at this level of description. The novelty used to define St′ (t) by comparison with S(t) does not come from the actual behavior at t or before, ex hypothesi. The cost of conflating St′(t) and S(t) is that the definition of St depends on ulterior phenomena and becomes a finalist description: this methodology has a bias towards a specific outcome by excluding many alternative changes which are not taken into account.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FK2QW76TC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</div>",

      "abstractNote": "Most mathematical modeling in biology relies either implicitly or explicitly on the epistemology of physics. The underlying conception is that the historicity of biological objects would not matter to understand a situation here and now, or, at least, historicity would not impact the method of modeling. We analyze that it is not the case with concrete examples. Historicity forces a conceptual reconfiguration where equations no longer play a central role. We argue that all observations depend on objects defined by their historical origin instead of their relations as in physics. Therefore, we propose that biological variations and historicity come first, and regularities are constraints with limited validity in biology. Their proper theoretical and empirical use requires specific rationales.",

A measurement relies on a symmetrization, that is to say, a specific way to consider that different organisms are equivalent despite qualitative differences. Symmetrization may be more or less strong; for example, one can study the metabolism or mammals or study the metabolism of a clonal population of cells. However, it is never possible to consider that a symmetrization would be perfect; variations are always possible. Moreover, stronger symmetrizations are not always better. They tend to provide more stable results, but these results may be specific to this symmetrization.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FZWGW9DBE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2020, p. 7</span>)</span> % end good summaary</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FLWP8RMZ6%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22QPA8YHZ8%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ff6666%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B353.833%2C296.63%2C544.336%2C308.99%5D%2C%5B306.142%2C284.13%2C452.28%2C296.49%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FZWGW9DBE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">In other words, we cannot separate proximate causes from the underlying history.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FZWGW9DBE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Montévil, 2020, p. 7</span>)</span> % this is the result and answer to Mayr's distinction.

      "abstractNote": "We address the identity of biological organisms at play in experimental and modeling practices. We ﬁrst examine the central tenets of two general conceptions, and we assess their respective strengths and weaknesses. The historical conception, on the one hand, characterizes organisms’ identity by looking at their past, and speciﬁcally at their genealogical connection with a common ancestor. The relational conception, on the other hand, interprets organisms’ identity by referring to a set of distinctive relations between their parts, and between the organism and its environment. While the historical and relational conceptions are understood as opposed and conﬂicting, we submit that they are also fundamentally complementary. Accordingly, we put forward a hybrid conception, in which historical and relational (and more speciﬁcally, organizational) aspects of organisms’ identity sustain and justify each other. Moreover, we argue that organisms’ identity is not only hybrid but also bounded, insofar as the compliance with speciﬁc identity criteria tends to vanish as time passes, especially across generations. We spell out the core conceptual framework of this conception, and we outline an original formal representation. We contend that the hybrid and bounded conception of organisms’ identity suits the epistemological needs of biological practices, particularly with regards to the generalization and reproducibility of experimental results, and the integration of mathematical models with experiments.",

we use D1 instead of D0, the diagram change corresponds to a change of identity. Alternatively, one may keep the initial identity and justify the articulation between the constraints and χ by the subclass D1 describing a partial closure that includes the constraints explicit in D0. In this case, D0 is complemented by a special case, D1, that justifies the articulation between χ and constraints in D0. This justification does not guarantee that the constraints under study are always functional in D0; however, it guarantees that they are in some cases. We can thus see D1 as an “organizational type” of D0, and write this concept as D0 [D1]. In a given situation, when the constraints involved are largely conserved, we can argue that D1 is representative of most cases, then other situations will be exceptions.</span> <span

This essay attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical, generating data and computational, to analyze them and reproduce them with models. This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.",

      "abstractNote": "The Anthropocene crisis is frequently described as the rarefaction of resources or resources per capita. However, both energy and minerals correspond to fundamentally conserved quantities from the perspective of physics. A specific concept is required to understand the rarefaction of available resources. This concept, entropy, pertains to energy and matter configurations and not just to their sheer amount. However, the physics concept of entropy is insufficient to understand biological and social organizations. Biological phenomena display both historicity and systemic properties. A biological organization, the ability of a specific living being to last over time, results from history, expresses itself by systemic properties, and may require generating novelties The concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination of these features. We propose that Anthropocene changes disrupt biological organizations by randomizing them, that is, decreasing anti-entropy. Moreover, second-order disruptions correspond to the decline of the ability to produce functional novelties, that is, to produce anti-entropy.",

      "abstractNote": "Biologists increasingly report anthropogenic disruptions of both organisms and ecosystems, suggesting that these processes are a fundamental, qualitative component of the Anthropocene. Nonetheless, the notion of disruption has not yet been theorized in biology. To progress in that regard, we work on a special case. Relatively minor temperature changes impact plant-pollinator synchrony, disrupting mutualistic interaction networks. Understanding this phenomenon requires a speciﬁc rationale since models describing them use both historical and systemic reasoning. Speciﬁcally, history justiﬁes that the system is initially in a very narrow part of the possibility space where it is viable, and the disruption randomizes this conﬁguration. Building on this rationale, we develop a formal framework inspired by Boltzmann’s entropy. With empirical networks, we show historical trends depending on latitude. Then we propose an initial deﬁnition of disruption in ecology. When a speciﬁc historical outcome contributes to a system’s viability, disruption randomizes this outcome, decreasing viability.",

      "abstractNote": "This perspective highlights the mean ergodic theorem established by John von Neumann and the pointwise ergodic theorem established by George Birkhoff, proofs of which were published nearly simultaneously in PNAS in 1931 and 1932. These theorems were of great significance both in mathematics and in statistical mechanics. In statistical mechanics they provided a key insight into a 60-y-old fundamental problem of the subject—namely, the rationale for the hypothesis that time averages can be set equal to phase averages. The evolution of this problem is traced from the origins of statistical mechanics and Boltzman's ergodic hypothesis to the Ehrenfests' quasi-ergodic hypothesis, and then to the ergodic theorems. We discuss communications between von Neumann and Birkhoff in the Fall of 1931 leading up to the publication of these papers and related issues of priority. These ergodic theorems initiated a new field of mathematical-research called ergodic theory that has thrived ever since, and we discuss some of recent developments in ergodic theory that are relevant for statistical mechanics.",

      "abstractNote": "The rhetoric of “excellence” is pervasive across the academy. It is used to refer to research outputs as well as researchers, theory and education, individuals and organizations, from art history to zoology. But does “excellence” actually mean anything? Does this pervasive narrative of “excellence” do any good? Drawing on a range of sources we interrogate “excellence” as a concept and ﬁnd that it has no intrinsic meaning in academia. Rather it functions as a linguistic interchange mechanism. To investigate whether this linguistic function is useful we examine how the rhetoric of excellence combines with narratives of scarcity and competition to show that the hyper-competition that arises from the performance of “excellence” is completely at odds with the qualities of good research. We trace the roots of issues in reproducibility, fraud, and homophily to this rhetoric. But we also show that this rhetoric is an internal, and not primarily an external, imposition. We conclude by proposing an alternative rhetoric based on soundness and capacity-building. In the ﬁnal analysis, it turns out that that “excellence” is not excellent. Used in its current unqualiﬁed form it is a pernicious and dangerous rhetoric that undermines the very foundations of good research and scholarship. This article is published as part of a collection on the future of research assessment.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper argues that biological organisation can be legitimately conceived of as an intrinsically teleological causal regime. The core of the argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination: biological organisation determines itself in the sense that the effects of its activity contribute to determine its own conditions of existence. We suggest that not any kind of circular regime realises self-determination, which should be speciﬁcally understood as self-constraint: in biological systems, in particular, selfconstraint takes the form of closure, i.e. a network of mutually dependent constitutive constraints. We then explore the occurrence of intrinsic teleology in the biological domain and beyond. On the one hand, the organisational account might possibly concede that supra-organismal biological systems (as symbioses or ecosystems) could realise closure, and hence be teleological. On the other hand, the realisation of closure beyond the biological realm appears to be highly unlikely. In turn, the occurrence of simpler forms of self-determination remains a controversial issue, in particular with respect to the case of self-organising dissipative systems.",

In particular, the existence of current traits is the consequence of the selection exerted on the effects produced by previous occurrences of the trait. In such a way, selection allows us to consider organisms as designed, and their history as teleological, insofar as the existence of a type of trait can be explained by some of its specific effects or consequences, that have contributed to the adaptation and survival of the organism to which the trait belongs.</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FDSXKSEJH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 5</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FMIBX7G6U%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22NFSWZKRM%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B138.512%2C490.333%2C388.046%2C499.458%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C478.372%2C388.035%2C487.497%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C466.42%2C388.081%2C475.545%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C454.458%2C388.048%2C463.584%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C442.506%2C69.83%2C451.632%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FDSXKSEJH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">the evolutionary account actually presupposes the existence of individual organisms that are able to survive and reproduce in their environment.

The underlying theoretical framework is that of (mainly French) molecular biology, centred on the notion of program (Jacob and Monod 1961; Mayr 1961; Jacob 1970; Monod 1970). In this line of thought, the concept of genetic program, in the context of Darwinian evolution, rehabilitates teleology (Jacob 1970,p.9)as an admissible scientific dimension. The central idea is that teleological behaviours, which control the form, as well as the adaptivity of biological organisms, are subtended by genetic molecular mechanisms.9 In turn, these mechanisms, by enabling the reproduction of the organism, determine the conditions of its own persistence. In this perspective, therefore, the goal is not extrinsic, but rather intrinsic to the system, since it is specified by a program that determines its future states. The program, in turn, has been specified by evolution (Jacob 1970,p.8)</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FDSXKSEJH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 8</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FMIBX7G6U%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22CF5XRDKJ%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.081%2C526.197%2C388.04%2C535.323%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C514.236%2C388.044%2C523.362%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C502.284%2C234.605%2C511.41%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FDSXKSEJH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">In doing so, Piaget elaborates the crucial theoretical concept of organisational closure, which he considers as complementary to that of thermodynamic openness, already emphasised by von Bertalanffy (1949)</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FDSXKSEJH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 10</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FMIBX7G6U%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22QESKZ3EG%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%235fb236%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B276.052%2C597.928%2C388.067%2C607.054%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C585.967%2C387.988%2C595.093%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C574.015%2C388.035%2C583.141%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C562.063%2C388.071%2C571.189%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C550.102%2C388.029%2C559.227%5D%2C%5B50.742%2C538.15%2C286.971%2C547.275%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FDSXKSEJH%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">According to them, autopoietic systems are systems without goals.

Organization constitutes an overarching hypothesis that frames the intelligibility of biological objects, by characterizing their relevant aspects. After a succinct historical survey on the understanding of organization in the organicist tradition, we offer a specific characterization in terms of closure of constraints. We then discuss some implications of the adoption of organization as a principle and, in particular, we focus on how it fosters an original approach to biological stability, as well as and its interplay with variation.",

      "abstractNote": "We develop a conceptual framework that connects biological heredity and organization. We refer to heredity as the cross-generation conservation of functional elements, defined as constraints subject to organizational closure. While hereditary objects are functional constituents of biological systems, any other entity that is stable across generations—and possibly involved in the recurrence of phenotypes—belongs to their environment. The central outcome of the organizational perspective consists in extending the scope of heredity beyond the genetic domain without merging it with the broad category of cross-generation stability. After discussing some implications, we conclude with a reflection on the relationship between stability and variation.",

      "abstractNote": "Have you ever seen the Citation Indexes (CIs) for the year 1600? At that time, a very active community was working on the reconstruction of planetary movements by means of epicycles. In principle, any ellipse around the Sun may be approximated by sufficiently many epicycles around the Earth. This is a non-trivial geometrical task, especially given the lack of analytical tools (sums of series). And the books and papers of many talented geometers quoted one another. Scientific knowledge, however, was already taking other directions. Science has a certain ‘inertia’, it is prudent (at times, it has been exceedingly so, mostly for political or metaphysical reasons), but even under the best of conditions, we all know how difficult it is to accept new ideas, to let them blossom in time, away from short-term pressures.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper provides a detailed analysis of the change process of academic science. The change pressures currently visible in UK science have been conceptualised as the product of three interdependent dynamics: a shift towards neo-liberal ideologies and discourses of government; a process of reconstitution of the relationship between government and science; and the resulting reshaping of science itself. Focusing on the universities and academic science, we argue that this process of transformation has adverse consequences the end result of which may be a loss of capacity within the science system to maintain knowledge bases.",

      "abstractNote": "This book contains the most sustained and serious attack on mainstream, neoclassical economics in more than forty years. Nelson and Winter focus their critique on the basic question of how firms and industries change overtime. They marshal significant objections to the fundamental neoclassical assumptions of profit maximization and market equilibrium, which they find ineffective in the analysis of technological innovation and the dynamics of competition among firms. To replace these assumptions, they borrow from biology the concept of natural selection to construct a precise and detailed evolutionary theory of business behavior. They grant that films are motivated by profit and engage in search for ways of improving profits, but they do not consider them to be profit maximizing. Likewise, they emphasize the tendency for the more profitable firms to drive the less profitable ones out of business, but they do not focus their analysis on hypothetical states of industry equilibrium. The results of their new paradigm and analytical framework are impressive. Not only have they been able to develop more coherent and powerful models of competitive firm dynamics under conditions of growth and technological change, but their approach is compatible with findings in psychology and other social sciences. Finally, their work has important implications for welfare economics and for government policy toward industry.",

      "abstractNote": "This collection of essays explores the metaphysical thesis that the living world is not ontologically made up of substantial particles or things, as has often been assumed, but is rather constituted by processes. The biological domain is organized as an interdependent hierarchy of processes, which are stabilized and actively maintained at different timescales. Even entities that intuitively appear to be paradigms of things, such as organisms, are actually better understood as processes. Unlike previous attempts to articulate processual views of biology, which have tended to use Alfred North Whitehead’s panpsychist metaphysics as a foundation, this book takes a naturalistic approach to metaphysics. It submits that the main motivations for replacing an ontology of substances with one of processes are to be looked for in the empirical findings of science. Biology provides compelling reasons for thinking that the living realm is fundamentally dynamic and that the existence of things is always conditional on the existence of processes. The phenomenon of life cries out for theories that prioritize processes over things, and it suggests that the central explanandum of biology is not change but rather stability—or, more precisely, stability attained through constant change. This multicontributor volume brings together philosophers of science and metaphysicians interested in exploring the consequences of a processual philosophy of biology. The contributors draw on an extremely wide range of biological case studies and employ a process perspective to cast new light on a number of traditional philosophical problems such as identity, persistence, and individuality.",

Citation indices help measure the interconnections between scientific papers but fall short because they fail to communicate contextual information about a citation. The use of citations in research evaluation without consideration of context can be problematic because a citation that presents contrasting evidence to a paper is treated the same as a citation that presents supporting evidence. To solve this problem, we have used machine learning, traditional document ingestion methods, and a network of researchers to develop a “smart citation index” called scite, which categorizes citations based on context. Scite shows how a citation was used by displaying the surrounding textual context from the citing paper and a classification from our deep learning model that indicates whether the statement provides supporting or contrasting evidence for a referenced work, or simply mentions it. Scite has been developed by analyzing over 25 million full-text scientific articles and currently has a database of more than 880 million classified citation statements. Here we describe how scite works and how it can be used to further research and research evaluation.",

      "abstractNote": "The concept of epigenetics has evolved since Waddington defined it from the late 1930s as the study of the causal mechanisms at work in development. It has become a multi-faceted notion with different meanings, depending on the disciplinary context it is used. In this article, we first analyse the transformations of the concept of epigenetics, from Waddington to contemporary accounts, in order to identify its different meanings and traditions, and to come up with a typology of epigenetics throughout its history. Second, we show on this basis that epigenetics has progressively turned its main focus from biological problems regarding development, toward issues concerning evolution. Yet, both these different epistemological aspects of epigenetics still coexist. Third, we claim that the classical opposition between epigenesis and preformationism as ways of thinking about the developmental process is part of the history of epigenetics and has contributed to its current various meanings. With these objectives in mind, we first show how Waddington introduced the term “epigenetics” in a biological context in order to solve a developmental problem, and we then build on this by presenting Nanney's, Riggs' and Holliday's definitions, which form the basis for the current conception of “molecular epigenetics”. Then, we show that the evo-devo research field is where some particular uses of epigenetics have started shifting from developmental issues to evolutionary problems. We also show that epigenetics has progressively focused on the issue of epigenetic inheritance within the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis' framework. Finally, we conclude by presenting a typology of the different conceptions of epigenetics throughout time, and analyse the connections between them. We argue that, since Waddington, epigenetics, as an integrative research area, has been used to bridge the gap between different biological fields.",

      "abstractNote": "The first systems analysis of the functioning of an organism was Claude Bernard's concept of the constancy of the internal environment (le milieu intérieur), since it implied the existence of control processes to achieve this. He can be regarded, therefore, as the first systems biologist. The new vogue for systems biology today is an important development, since it is time to complement reductionist molecular biology by integrative approaches. Claude Bernard foresaw that this would require the application of mathematics to biology. This aspect of Claude Bernard's work has been neglected by physiologists, which is why we are not as ready to contribute to the development of systems biology as we should be. In this paper, I outline some general principles that could form the basis of systems biology as a truly multilevel approach from a physiologist's standpoint. We need the insights obtained from higher-level analysis in order to succeed even at the lower levels. The reason is that higher levels in biological systems impose boundary conditions on the lower levels. Without understanding those conditions and their effects, we will be seriously restricted in understanding the logic of living systems. The principles outlined are illustrated with examples from various aspects of physiology and biochemistry. Applying and developing these principles should form a major part of the future of physiology.",

      "abstractNote": "Biophysics at the systems level, as distinct from molecular biophysics, acquired its most famous paradigm in the work of Hodgkin and Huxley, who integrated their equations for the nerve impulse in 1952. Their approach has since been extended to other organs of the body, notably including the heart. The modern field of computational biology has expanded rapidly during the first decade of the twenty-first century and, through its contribution to what is now called systems biology, it is set to revise many of the fundamental principles of biology, including the relations between genotypes and phenotypes. Evolutionary theory, in particular, will require re-assessment. To succeed in this, computational and systems biology will need to develop the theoretical framework required to deal with multilevel interactions. While computational power is necessary, and is forthcoming, it is not sufficient. We will also require mathematical insight, perhaps of a nature we have not yet identified. This article is therefore also a challenge to mathematicians to develop such insights.",

      "abstractNote": "This article argues that the gene-centric interpretations of evolution, and more particularly the selfish gene expression of those interpretations, form barriers to the integration of physiological science with evolutionary theory. A gene-centred approach analyses the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes in terms of differences (change the genotype and observe changes in phenotype). We now know that, most frequently, this does not correctly reveal the relationships because of extensive buffering by robust networks of interactions. By contrast, understanding biological function through physiological analysis requires an integrative approach in which the activity of the proteins and RNAs formed from each DNA template is analysed in networks of interactions. These networks also include components that are not specified by nuclear DNA. Inheritance is not through DNA sequences alone. The selfish gene idea is not useful in the physiological sciences, since selfishness cannot be defined as an intrinsic property of nucleotide sequences independently of gene frequency, i.e. the ‘success’ in the gene pool that is supposed to be attributable to the ‘selfish’ property. It is not a physiologically testable hypothesis.",

This article examines the conceptual framework of neo-Darwinism, including the concepts of 'gene', 'selfish', 'code', 'program', 'blueprint', 'book of life', 'replicator' and 'vehicle'. This form of representation is a barrier to extending or replacing existing theory as it confuses conceptual and empirical matters. These need to be clearly distinguished. In the case of the central concept of 'gene', the definition has moved all the way from describing a necessary cause (defined in terms of the inheritable phenotype itself) to an empirically testable hypothesis (in terms of causation by DNA sequences). Neo-Darwinism also privileges 'genes' in causation, whereas in multi-way networks of interactions there can be no privileged cause. An alternative conceptual framework is proposed that avoids these problems, and which is more favourable to an integrated systems view of evolution.",

      "abstractNote": "The Modern Synthesis has dominated biology for 80 years. It was formulated in 1942, a decade before the major achievements of molecular biology, including the Double Helix and the Central Dogma. When first formulated in the 1950s these discoveries and concepts seemed initially to completely justify the central genetic assumptions of the Modern Synthesis. The Double Helix provided the basis for highly accurate DNA replication, while the Central Dogma was viewed as supporting the Weismann Barrier, so excluding the inheritance of acquired characteristics. This article examines the language of the Modern Synthesis and reveals that it is based on four important misinterpretations of what molecular biology had shown, so forming the basis of the four Illusions: 1. Natural Selection; 2. The Weismann Barrier; 3. The Rejection of Darwin’s Gemmules; 4. The Central Dogma. A multi-level organisation view of biology avoids these illusions through the principle of biological relativity. Molecular biology does not therefore confirm the assumptions of the Modern Synthesis.",

The genome is not a code, blueprint or set of instructions. It is a tool orchestrated by the system. This book shows that gene-centrism misrepresents what genes are and how they are used by living systems. It demonstrates how organisms make choices, influencing their behaviour, their development and evolution, and act as agents  of natural selection. It presents a novel approach to fundamental philosophical and cultural issues, such as free-will. Reading this book will make you see life in a new light, as a marvellous phenomenon, and in some sense a triumph of evolution. We are not in our genes, our genes are in us.",

Progress in robotics will help to make life easier, richer and healthier. Wider robot use will help raise labour productivity. As science and engineering progress, robots will become more central to crisis response, from helping combat infectious diseases to maintaining critical infrastructure. Governments can accelerate and orient the development and uptake of socially valuable robots, for instance by: supporting cross-disciplinary R&amp;D, facilitating research commercialisation, helping small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) understand the opportunities for investment in robots, supporting platforms that highlight robot solutions in healthcare and other sectors, embedding robotics engineering in high school curricula, tailoring training for workers with vocational-level mechanical skills, supporting data development useful to robotics, ensuring flexible regulation conducive to innovation, strengthening digital connectivity, and raising awareness of the importance of robotics.",

      "abstractNote": "The persistence of ecological systems in changing environments requires energy, materials, and information. Although the importance of information to ecological function has been widely recognized, the fundamental principles of ecological science as commonly expressed do not reflect this central role of information processing. We articulate five fundamental principles of ecology that integrate information with energy and material constraints across scales of organization in living systems. We show how these principles outline new theoretical and empirical research challenges, and offer one novel attempt to incorporate them in a theoretical model. To provide adequate background for the principles, we review major concepts and identify common themes and key differences in information theories spanning physics, biology and semiotics. We structured our review around a series of questions about the role information may play in ecological systems: (i) what is information? (ii) how is information related to uncertainty? (iii) what is information processing? (iv) does information processing link ecological systems across scales? We highlight two aspects of information that capture its dual roles: syntactic information defining the processes that encode, filter and process information stored in biological structure and semiotic information associated with structures and their context. We argue that the principles of information in living systems promote a unified approach to understanding living systems in terms of first principles of biology and physics, and promote much needed theoretical and empirical advances in ecological research to unify understanding across disciplines and scales.",

The main elements of this project have been an extensive survey of individual funding schemes in different countries, complemented with targeted interviews. Findings from the survey and interviews, completed with contextual data on national research funding trends, were analysed to identify major challenges for competitive funding processes and to propose options to overcome them. This report is aimed both at the research funding community and policy-makers wishing to adapt competitive research funding strategies to different objectives. It includes a number of policy recommendations, which engage different actors and are derived from the analysis including identification of gaps in the available data and information.",

The COVID-19 pandemic, which struck as this report was being finalised, has underscored the critical importance of data-intensive science and the need for strategic approaches to strengthening the digital capacity and skills of the scientific enterprise as a whole.

The analysis in this paper is primarily based on a survey of individual HRHR research funding schemes in different countries, complemented by targeted interviews. This survey was supplemented by an analysis of HRHR research-oriented programmes and by the feedback from an international workshop that included all relevant stakeholders.",

      "abstractNote": "The ascendancy of neoliberalism and the associated discourses of ‘new public management’, during the 1980s and 1990s has produced a fundamental shift in the way universities and other institutions of higher education have defined and justified their institutional existence. The traditional professional culture of open intellectual enquiry and debate has been replaced with a institutional stress on performativity, as evidenced by the emergence of an emphasis on measured outputs: on strategic planning, performance indicators, quality assurance measures and academic audits. This paper traces the links between neoliberalism and globalization on the one hand, and neoliberalism and the knowledge economy on the other. It maintains that in a global neoliberal environment, the role of higher education for the economy is seen by governments as having greater importance to the extent that higher education has become the new star ship in the policy fleet for governments around the world. Universities are seen as a key driver in the knowledge economy and as a consequence higher education institutions have been encouraged to develop links with industry and business in a series of new venture partnerships. The recognition of economic importance of higher education and the necessity for economic viability has seen initiatives to promote greater entrepreneurial skills as well as the development of new performative measures to enhance output and to establish and achieve targets. This paper attempts to document these trends at the level of both political philosophy and economic theory.",

      "abstractNote": "This document provides learnings from 13 case studies on governance mechanisms of national and supranational science, technology and innovation initiatives. As countries strive to resolve societal challenges, “mission-oriented” approaches complement traditional ones centred on national competitiveness, specific industrial sectors or technologies. Governance settings contribute overall to a more inclusive, transparent and responsible STI system, in particular through a whole-of-government approach, the consultation of academia, the private sector and civil society, the implementation of strategies by professional agencies, and the increasingly common use of evaluation. Several critical dimensions facilitate the success of STI policies. They include a commitment at the highest level of government, strong public-private collaboration in R&amp;D, continuous evaluation and improvement, a “mission-oriented” approach, coherence of policies and flexibility in setting priorities, as well as overall harmonisation and rationalisation of programmes in order to maximise efficiency and reduce duplication.",

      "abstractNote": "The breakdown of ergodic behaviour is discussed as a general phenomenon in condensed matter physics. Broken symmetry is a particular case of this broken ergodicity. In a system that is non-ergodic on physical timescales the phase point is effectively confined in one subregion or component of phase space. Theoretical treatments of such systems should compute thermal averages over one component at a time. The probability distribution of physical properties can then be obtained from occurrence probabilities for different components, and moments of these distributions may be used for predicting the results of typical measurements. A two-level statistical mechanics is therefore proposed. Various aspects of the breakdown of ergodicity are discussed, including: the definition of components; mechanisms for the confinement of components; methods for computing the properties of one component; the choice of occurrence probabilities for different components; and average thermodynamic properties of broken ergodicity systems. The theory is illustrated by application to well-understood systems. It is also applied to the spin glass, which is reviewed in some detail. The broken ergodicity viewpoint is combined with a suggested characterization of the components in a spin glass, involving a bifurcation cascade. Together these provide a qualitative explanation for the irreversibility signature, the long time decays, the apparent failure of linear response theory and Maxwell relations, and blocking.",

      "abstractNote": "Evolution of self-replicating macromolecules through natural selection is a dynamically ordered process. Two concepts are introduced to describe the physical regularity of macromolecular evolution: sequence space and quasi-species. Natural selection means localization of a mutant distribution in sequence space. This localized distribution, called the quasi-species, is centered around a master sequence (or a degenerate set), that the biologist would call the wild-type. The self-ordering of such a system is an essential consequence of its formation through self-reproduction of its macromolecular consti tuents, a process that in the dynamical equations expresses itself by positive diagonal coefficients called selective values. The theory describes how population numbers of wild type and mutants are related to the distribution of selective values, that is to say, how value topography maps into population topography. For selectively (nearly) neutral mutants appearing in the quasi- species distribution, population numbers are greatly enhanced as compared to those of disadvantageous mutants, even more so in continuous domains of such selectively valuable mutants. As a consequence, mutants far distant from the wild type may occur because they are produced with the help of highly populated, less distant precursors. Since values are cohesively distributed, like mountains on earth, and since their positions are multiply connected in the high-dimensional sequence space, the overpopulation of (nearly) neural mutants provides guidance for the evolutionary process. Localization in sequence space, subject to a threshold in the fidelity of reproduction, is steadily challenged until an optimal state is reached. The model has been designed according to experimentally determined properties of self-replicating molecules. The conclusions reached from the theoretical models can be used to construct machines that provide optimal conditions for the evolution of functional macromolecules.",

      "abstractNote": "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This paper reports a qualitative investigation of students' epistemological beliefs in science and in chemistry and how such epistemology is linked with students' metacognitive behaviors. Epistemological beliefs are conceptualized as being made up of independent dimensions activated in context and operating as epistemic cognition. Epistemological beliefs of nine cases were initially ascertained from an administration of the Epistemological Beliefs Assessment for Physical Sciences (EBAPS). Analyses of various qualitative data afforded the tagging of cases as exhibiting naïve or sophisticated epistemology. Results established the non-orthogonality of the different dimensions of epistemological beliefs as evidenced by cases exhibiting naïve epistemology in one dimension and, at the same time, manifesting sophisticated epistemology in another dimension. The paper reiterates that epistemological beliefs contribute to students' metacognitive behaviors. Cases exhibiting naïve epistemology resort to simplistic ways of acquiring knowledge and demonstrate low metacognitive behaviors. On the other hand, cases manifesting sophisticated epistemology select study strategies for understanding, are more engaged in their learning, and overtly demonstrated high metacognitive behaviors.</div>",

      "abstractNote": "Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.",

      "abstractNote": "Research councils began as channels for state patronage of science (a widespread phenomenon after World War II) and were captured by the scientists: peer review of proposals, panels, board membership. In this way, they became an important organ of the ‘Republic of Science’ (Michael Polanyi's concept). Being awarded a grant is now as important for the reputation or status of a scientist as the money value per se: research councils have become part of the reward system of science. Credibility-cycle analysis (Latour and Woolgar) is used to show this; and then applied to the research council itself, between the State and the national scientific community. Current concerns about proposal success rates and conservatism are analysed in terms of dynamics of this research world. This sociological approach to research councils allows analysis of changes in the reward system of science (where ‘relevance’ is becoming an accepted criterion world-wide) and of the complex environment of research councils, where many actors now compete for the intermediary role. Research councils must also become entrepreneurial-or become obsolete.",

      "abstractNote": "This project aims to bring to fruition a theoretical framework that posits nonmechanistic principles for understanding organisms. It proposes to elaborate methods, know-how and generally applicable guidelines that will allow biologists to make these concepts their own, and use them in practice to generate new knowledge. The epistemological question regards the types of knowledge that one can generate with models stemming from theories that emphasize, for example, the irreducible unpredictability of the variation of organisms or the speciﬁc circularity of their organization. Oscillating between modeling and critical reﬂexivity, this work will mature thanks to methodological experiments that will be the object of scientiﬁc publications, and thanks to discussions with several epistemologists concerning the diﬃculties (inherent or accidental) encountered along the way. By contributing to the understanding of viable organizational modes of material and functional entities, this interdisciplinary work also grounds relevant concepts to think/heal (pænser ) the Anthropocene.",

To do so, we design a microscopic model for water and put the liquid on an equal footing with the graphene described by its electronic band structure. By evaluating progressively the electronic and dipolar coupled electrostatic interactions, we show that the coupling level including mutual graphene and water screening permits one to recover remarkably the precision of extensive quantum simulations. We further derive the potential of mean force evolution of several alkali cations.",

      "abstractNote": "Artificial intelligence has made tremendous advances since its inception about seventy years ago. Self-driving cars, programs beating experts at complex games, and smart robots capable of assisting people that need care are just some among the successful examples of machine intelligence. This kind of progress might entice us to envision a society populated by autonomous robots capable of performing the same tasks humans do in the near future. This prospect seems limited only by the power and complexity of current computational devices, which is improving fast. However, there are several significant obstacles on this path. General intelligence involves situational reasoning, taking perspectives, choosing goals, and an ability to deal with ambiguous information. We observe that all of these characteristics are connected to the ability of identifying and exploiting new affordances—opportunities (or impediments) on the path of an agent to achieve its goals. A general example of an affordance is the use of an object in the hands of an agent. We show that it is impossible to predefine a list of such uses. Therefore, they cannot be treated algorithmically. This means that “AI agents” and organisms differ in their ability to leverage new affordances. Only organisms can do this. This implies that true AGI is not achievable in the current algorithmic frame of AI research. It also has important consequences for the theory of evolution. We argue that organismic agency is strictly required for truly open-ended evolution through radical emergence. We discuss the diverse ramifications of this argument, not only in AI research and evolution, but also for the philosophy of science.",

Does this imply that in the past the world was in a non-generic microstate? I point out an alternative. The subsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small number of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to depends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe depends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low past entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate of the universe) is non-generic. I argue that for any generic microstate of a sufficiently rich system there are always special subsystems defining a coarse graining for which the entropy of the rest is low in one time direction (the “past”)</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FGV59HLT8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rovelli, 2017, p. 1</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FHRVC67QJ%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22UXFG327P%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C298.085%2C299.077%2C306.932%5D%2C%5B54%2C286.628%2C299.077%2C295.475%5D%2C%5B54%2C275.171%2C299.086%2C284.018%5D%2C%5B54%2C263.714%2C299.081%2C272.561%5D%2C%5B54%2C252.257%2C299.081%2C261.104%5D%2C%5B54%2C240.8%2C299.078%2C249.647%5D%2C%5B54%2C228.429%2C299.076%2C238.19%5D%2C%5B54%2C217.886%2C299.084%2C226.733%5D%2C%5B54%2C206.429%2C299.076%2C215.276%5D%2C%5B54%2C194.972%2C83.886%2C203.819%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FasN0yRvl%2Fitems%2FGV59HLT8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223%22%7D%7D\">The “choice” of macroscopic observables is dictated by the ways the system under consideration couples.

      "abstractNote": "I discuss three aspects of the notion of agency from the standpoint of physics: (i) what makes a physical system an agent; (ii) the reason for agency's time orientation; (iii) the source of the information generated in choosing an action. I observe that agency is the breaking of an approximation under which dynamics appears closed. I distinguish different notions of agency, and observe that the answer to the questions above differ in different cases. I notice a structural similarity between agency and memory, that allows us to model agency, trace its time asymmetry to thermodynamical irreversibility, and identify the source of the information generated by agency in the growth of entropy. Agency is therefore a physical mechanism that transforms low entropy into information. This may be the general mechanism at the source of the whole information on which biology builds.",

Surprisingly, (i) systems separation with (ii) temperature differences and (iii) long thermalization times are sufﬁcient conditions to produce macroscopic traces. Traces of the past are ubiquitous because these conditions are largely satisﬁed in our universe. I quantify these thermodynamical conditions for memory and derive an expression for the maximum amount of information stored in such memories as a function of the relevant thermodynamical parameters. This mechanism transforms low entropy into available information. I suggest that all macroscopic information has this origin in past low entropy.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding the quality of science systems requires international comparative studies, which are difficult because of the lack of comparable data especially about inputs in research. In this study, we deploy an approach based on change instead of on levels of inputs and outputs: an approach that to a large extent eliminates the problem of measurement differences between countries. We firstly show that there are large differences in efficiency between national science systems, defined as the increase in output (highly cited papers) per percentage increase in input (funding). We then discuss our findings using popular explanations of performance differences: differences in funding systems (performance related or not), differences in the level of competition, differences in the level of university autonomy, and differences in the level of academic freedom. Interestingly, the available data do not support these common explanations. What the data suggest is that efficient systems are characterized by a well-developed ex post evaluation system combined with considerably high institutional funding and relatively low university autonomy (meaning a high autonomy of professionals). On the other hand, the less efficient systems have a strong ex ante control, either through a high level of so-called competitive project funding, or through strong power of the university management. Another conclusion is that more and better data are needed.",

      "abstractNote": "Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger's What is Life? is one of the great science classics of the twentieth century. A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent science-policy debates have emphasised a growing role for science in helping to address some of society's most pressing challenges such as global environmental change, caring for the needs of ageing populations, and competitiveness in a global age. Other ‘relevance’ pressures include drives for public accountability, pressure for the ‘democratisation’ of science and demands from industry for usable knowledge. Underlying the question of the social relevance of science is the matter of decision-making and quality control in science, usually via the peer-review process. Peer review plays a central role in many of the key moments in science. It is the main form of decision-making around grant selection, academic publishing and the promotion of individual scientists within universities and research institutions. It also underpins methods used to evaluate scientific institutions. Yet, peer review as currently practised can be narrowly scientific, to the exclusion of other pressing quality criteria relating to social relevance. It is often also controlled and practised by scientists to the exclusion of wider groups that might bring valuable perspectives. This article sets out to examine peer review through the lens of social relevance. It challenges peer review as currently practised and makes some suggestions for ways forward.",

      "abstractNote": "Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.",

      "abstractNote": "The metaphorical adoption of the concepts of information, program and signal introduced into biology the logic and implicit causal structure of the mathematical theories of information; this is inimical to biology. In turn, those metaphors have hindered the development of a theory of organisms by transferring the agency of organisms to natural selection and to DNA. Moreover, those metaphors introduced into biology the dualism software-hardware and a Laplacian causal structure. Instead, we propose to uphold the agency of the living by adopting three foundational principles for a theory of organisms: namely, 1) the principle of biological inertia (i.e., the default state of cells is proliferation and motility), 2) the principle of variation, and 3) the principle of organization.",

      "abstractNote": "In the three decades since endocrine disruption was conceptualized at the Wingspread Conference, we have witnessed the growth of this multidisciplinary field and the accumulation of evidence showing the deleterious health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. It is only within the past decade that, albeit slowly, some changes regarding regulatory measures have taken place. In this Perspective, we address some historical points regarding the advent of the endocrine disruption field and the conceptual changes that endocrine disruption brought about. We also provide our personal recollection of the events triggered by our serendipitous discovery of oestrogenic activity in plastic, a founder event in the field of endocrine disruption. This recollection ends with the CLARITY study as an example of a discordance between ‘science for its own sake’ and ‘regulatory science’ and leads us to offer a perspective that could be summarized by the motto attributed to Ludwig Boltzmann: “Nothing is more practical than a good theory”.",

      "abstractNote": "The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of evolution typically assumes that the set of possible phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular space equipped with a notion of distance, for example, a Euclidean vector space. Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype-phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution-such as punctuation, irreversibility, modularity--result naturally from the properties of this space. The classical framework, however, addresses these patterns by exclusively invoking natural selection on suitably imposed fitness landscapes. We propose to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the genotype-phenotype map. We introduce the mathematical concepts and tools necessary to formalize the notion of accessibility pre-topology relative to which we can speak of continuity in the genotype-phenotype map and in evolutionary trajectories. We connect the factorization of a pre-topology into a product space with the notion of phenotypic character and derive a condition for factorization. Based on anecdotal evidence from the RNA model, we conjecture that this condition is not globally fulfilled, but rather confined to regions where the genotype-phenotype map is continuous. Equivalently, local regions of genotype space on which the map is discontinuous are associated with the loss of character autonomy. This is consistent with the importance of these regions for phenotypic innovation. The intention of the present paper is to offer a perspective, a framework to implement this perspective, and a few results illustrating how this framework can be put to work. The RNA case is used as an example throughout the text.",

      "abstractNote": "These lectures outline the project of a general organology, which is to say an account of life when it is no longer just biological but technical, or when it involves not just organic matter but organized inorganic matter. This organology is also shown to require a modiﬁed Simondonian account of the shift from vital individuation to a three-stranded process of psychic, collective and technical individuation. Furthermore, such an approach involves extending the Derridean reading of Socrates’s discussion of writing as a pharmakon, so that it becomes a more general account of the pharmacological character of retention and protention. By going back to Leroi-Gourhan, we can recognize that this also means pursuing the history of retentional modiﬁcations unfolding in the course of the history of what, with Lotka, can also be called exosomatization. It is thus a question of how exteriorization can, today, in an epoch when it becomes digital, and in an epoch that produces vast amounts of entropy at the thermodynamic, biological and noetic levels, still possibly produce new forms of interiorization, that is, new forms of thought, care and desire, amounting to so many chances to struggle against the planetaryscale pharmacological crisis with which we are currently afﬂicted.",

      "abstractNote": "Scientific inquiry, like all other human activity, cannot be separated from the humans conducting the inquiry. While public discourse often treats science as sacrosanct and scientists as devoid of any but the purest motives, the science of science literature has long understood scientific inquiry as a fundamentally social activity undertaken by self-interested, partial, human choosers with limited information (Polanyi in Minerva 1(1):54–73, 1962; Kuhn in The structure of scientific revolutions. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 1962; Leonard in J Econ Methodol 9(2):141–168, 2002). In this essay, we review the assumptions of two of the original contributions to the science of science literature regarding human agents and compare them to the assumptions underlying economic models. We assert that Michael Polanyi and Thomas Kuhn did for the science of science literature what Buchanan and Tullock (The calculus of consent: Logical foundations of constitutional democracy. Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1962) did for politics in the 1950s, which is to reassert behavioral symmetry. We then extend some of Buchanan’s insights from his study of politics and constitutions, public choice and constitutional political economy, to the study of science and draw out implications for interest-group influence in the republic of science.",

      "abstractNote": "There is increasing evidence that scientific misconduct is more common than previously thought. Strong emphasis on scientific productivity may increase the sense of publication pressure. We administered a nationwide survey to Flemish biomedical scientists on whether they had engaged in scientific misconduct and whether they had experienced publication pressure. A total of 315 scientists participated in the survey; 15% of the respondents admitted they had fabricated, falsified, plagiarized, or manipulated data in the past 3 years. Fraud was more common among younger scientists working in a university hospital. Furthermore, 72% rated publication pressure as ?too high.? Publication pressure was strongly and significantly associated with a composite scientific misconduct severity score.",

You e-mail the paper's authors, politely asking for key parameters they omitted. Receiving no response, you determine the parameters instead from the authors' graphs.

Epistémologies et pratiques de la modélisation et de la simulation\" (Tome 1, 2013) propose une classification raisonnée des différents types de modèles et de simulations actuellement en usage dans les sciences. Partant d'une approche comparative, elle se fonde sur des distinctions entre modèles conçues en termes de fonction épistémique, de nature et de principe. Elle propose en particulier d'identifier 20 différentes fonctions épistémiques pour les modèles contemporains. Elle distingue également trois types distincts de simulation sur ordinateur en fonction de leur usage épistémique des symboles oeuvrant dans la computation. Elle distingue enfin les simulations de modèles des modèles de simulation, les modèles de simulation pouvant eux-mêmes finalement être subdivisés encore en 2 catégories distinctes.",

      "abstractNote": "Darwin proposed that evolutionary novelties are environmentally induced in organisms “constitutionally” sensitive to environmental change, with selection effective owing to the inheritance of constitutional responses. A molecular theory of inheritance, pangenesis, explained the cross‐generational transmission of environmentally induced traits, as required for evolution by natural selection. The twentieth‐century evolutionary synthesis featured mutation as the source of novelty, neglecting the role of environmental induction. But current knowledge of environmentally sensitive gene expression, combined with the idea of genetic accommodation of mutationally and environmentally induced change, supports a revival of Darwin's original theory that is consistent with modern molecular and population genetics.",

      "abstractNote": "1.It is likely that internal factors play an important role in restricting the possible avenues of evolutionary change from any starting point. Internal selective processes operating on premutational disturbances, on mutations, and on developmental phases may usefully be separated from the adaptive selection of phenotypes.2.The precise structural and morphological consequences of internal factors should soon become an isolable problem owing to a) the observational correlation of definite changes in hereditary specificity with particular developmental consequences; and b) the progressive theoretical identification of the coordinative conditions in organisms.3.Increasing clarity regarding the coordinative conditions should throw light on the “mutational selection rules” and on the differentiative mutations which led to the most important steps in the past history of evolution.",

      "abstractNote": "We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the collapse of a two-domain protein, the BphC enzyme, into a globular structure to examine how water molecules mediate hydrophobic collapse of proteins. In the interdomain region, liquid water persists with a density 10to 15% lower than in the bulk, even at small domain separations. Water depletion and hydrophobic collapse occur on a nanosecond time scale, which is two orders of magnitude slower than that found in the collapse of idealized paraffin-like plates. When the electrostatic protein-water forces are turned off, a dewetting transition occurs in the interdomain region and the collapse speeds up by more than an order of magnitude. When attractive van der Waals forces are turned off as well, the dewetting in the interdomain region is more profound, and the collapse is even faster.",
