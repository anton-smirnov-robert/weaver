And yet, I still had none.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t alone in that experience. 
<a href=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/366047 rel=noopener>In my last story</a> I shared why so many people hunt for self-worth in their careers or businesses and end up at best burned out, and at worst in chronic emotional pain.</p><p>Urgency. Competition. Measure up. Improve. <em>More.</em></p><p>We&rsquo;ve been conditioned to believe that if we work hard enough and optimize ourselves, we&rsquo;ll get &ldquo;there&rdquo; sooner.</p><p>There is no there.</p><p>We think we&rsquo;re evolved human beings in charge of our destiny. In truth, we&rsquo;ve been conditioned to work long, fast, and hard to earn the right to feel &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo;</p><p>There is nothing empowering about it.</p><p>Collective unworthiness is the fuel that feeds our society. Humans have turned self-worth into something we need to hunt for, and our careers are a powerful way to pump up our inner metrics. We&rsquo;re desperate for someone or something to validate our existence.</p><p>Grinding to the bone has a glaring limitation: self-worth requires no work, is readily available, and free.</p><p>Not very catchy, but it&rsquo;s true.</p><p>Reclaiming your self worth starts with understanding where you&rsquo;ve created dependency models, or are hunting for your worth externally. Then it&rsquo;s time to dismantle the systems of oppression.</p><p>Today, we&rsquo;ll walk through six ways to help you transform from a &ldquo;human doing&rdquo; into a human being.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t try to do all six. This isn&rsquo;t a competition you can earn self-worth from, or win! Pick the path of least resistance by choosing two that look doable.</p><a href=#1-why-am-i-good><h2 id=1-why-am-i-good><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1. Why am I good?</h2></a><p>Write &ldquo;Why am I good?&rdquo; at the top of a piece of lined paper. Write a reason why you are a good or worthwhile person on each line. Stop after ten minutes.</p><p>You might find this easy or very, very hard.</p><p>Now go through and highlight every reason you&rsquo;re worthwhile that involves you 
<a href=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294922 rel=noopener>being productive,</a> achieving something, earning money, improving a skill, counting steps on your 
<a href=https://www.entrepreneur.com/amphtml/363360 rel=noopener>Fitbit</a>, or optimizing yourself in some way.</p><p>Now go through with a different colour and highlight all the examples of innate worth: things that require zero action or external validation, or are simply traits or qualities you believe to be true about yourself.</p><p>Compare the lengths of the lists.</p><p>Ideally your second list should be far longer than your first. Sadly, that&rsquo;s rarely the case.

I&rsquo;m the daughter of a kind and generous man who brought a suitcase of files home and slept for two hours a night.

In our first Zoom session I saw her eyes darting to where I knew she was getting bombarded with an endless barrage of Slack messages.</p><p>Why couldn&rsquo;t she turn them off? Because she&rsquo;s a wonderful woman who has 
<a href=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358918 rel=noopener>no boundaries!</a></p><p>All good design needs constraints. All humans wanting to have innate worth need to be ready to set boundaries around when they are available, restate them relentlessly, and reinforce them ruthlessly.</p><p>I have a no weekend work policy in my business.
