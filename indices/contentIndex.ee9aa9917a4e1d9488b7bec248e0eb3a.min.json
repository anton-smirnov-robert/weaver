A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers. It requires a (readable, writtable, and movable) infinite 1D bit register — a tape. Turing has shown that those elementary instructions are enough to do elaborate any sophisticated program that are themselves encoded on the tape. The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded. The operating system read the instructions as it computes the program and change the input binary string. Increasing the complexity of the machine (e.g. alphabet, dimensions) does not change the class of functions it can computes ([recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)s). \n\n\n#### Details \n\n**What is the formal definition of a Turing machine ?** \nThe alphabet of the tape $\\Gamma$ can be thought to be 0's and 1's and blank's. \n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\text { A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, }\\left(Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, q_{0}, q_{\\text {accept }}, q_{\\text {reject }}\\right) \\text {, where } \\\\ Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma \\text { are all finite sets and } \\\\ \\text { 1. } Q \\text { is the set of states, } \\\\ \\text { 2. } \\Sigma \\text { is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol } \\sqcup \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 3. } \\Gamma \\text { is the tape alphabet, where } \\sqcup \\in \\Gamma \\text { and } \\Sigma \\subseteq \\Gamma \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 4. } \\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\longrightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times\\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\} \\text { is the transition function, } \\\\ \\text { 5. } q_{0} \\in Q \\text { is the start state, } \\\\ \\text { 6. } q_{\\text {accept }} \\in Q \\text { is the accept state, and } \\\\ \\text { 7. } q_{\\text {reject }} \\in Q \\text { is the reject state, where } q_{\\text {reject }} \\neq q_{\\text {accept }}\\end{array}$$\n\n**How to write the program (or diagram or table of instructions) in the machine ?**\n\nWe write $S_0=blank$ , $S_1=0$ and $S_2=1$, $R=move \\ right$, $L= move \\ left$ . \nAn instruction can be written $q_i S_i S_j R q_m$  or  $q_i S_i S_j L q_m$.

The concepts of (hardware and software-independent) [computability](concept/computability.md), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developped in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (were cryptography played a major role), [Schrödinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrödinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. \n\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n[Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) is an explanation for [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) using the four bases discovered in the DNA. It relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). However, the DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very law succes and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). Moreover, biological phenomena are not deterministic. For humans, the mortality of fertilized eggs (embryos) before giving birth is about 50% ([Jarvis2016](reference/Jarvis2016.md)). There is no Turing's architect and  robust, iterative steps. \n\nThe informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. Molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md).  For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that that isogenic cells are identical where Protein and mRNA copy numbers are uncorrelated in isogenic cells.  \nnumber of DNA chains in two [Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)\n\n\na single cell's protein and mRNA copy numbers for any given gene are uncorrelated.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e*If a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle.* —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-08T10:13:58.542526152Z","tags":null},"/reference/Anfinsen1973":{"title":"Anfinsen1973","content":"\n**Principles that govern the folding of protein chains**     \nby Anfinsen C.B.
