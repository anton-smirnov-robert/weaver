He pictures not a mecanism but a person — “Turing's architect” according to ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)) Turing introduced ([Turing1936](reference/Turing1936.md)) this machine trying to answer questions regarding decidability. A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers. It requires a (readable, writtable, and movable) infinite 1D bit register — a tape. Turing has shown that those elementary instructions are enough to do elaborate any sophisticated program that are themselves encoded on the tape. The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded. The operating system read the instructions as it computes the program and change the input binary string. Increasing the complexity of the machine (e.g. alphabet, dimensions) does not change the class of functions it can computes ([recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)s). \n\n\n#### Details \n\n**What is the formal definition of a Turing machine ?** \nThe alphabet of the tape $\\Gamma$ can be thought to be 0's and 1's and blank's. \n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\text { A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, }\\left(Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, q_{0}, q_{\\text {accept }}, q_{\\text {reject }}\\right) \\text {, where } \\\\ Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma \\text { are all finite sets and } \\\\ \\text { 1. } Q \\text { is the set of states, } \\\\ \\text { 2. } \\Sigma \\text { is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol } \\sqcup \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 3. } \\Gamma \\text { is the tape alphabet, where } \\sqcup \\in \\Gamma \\text { and } \\Sigma \\subseteq \\Gamma \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 4. } \\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\longrightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times\\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\} \\text { is the transition function, } \\\\ \\text { 5. } q_{0} \\in Q \\text { is the start state, } \\\\ \\text { 6. } q_{\\text {accept }} \\in Q \\text { is the accept state, and } \\\\ \\text { 7. } q_{\\text {reject }} \\in Q \\text { is the reject state, where } q_{\\text {reject }} \\neq q_{\\text {accept }}\\end{array}$$\n\n**How to write the program (or diagram or table of instructions) in the machine ?**\n\nWe write $S_0=blank$ , $S_1=0$ and $S_2=1$, $R=move \\ right$, $L= move \\ left$ . \nAn instruction can be written $q_i S_i S_j R q_m$  or  $q_i S_i S_j L q_m$.

De cette conception émane une épistémologie adaptée à l’étude de la matière inerte. La biologie, sous forte influence de la physique, peine à se démarquer de la discipline faite reine par construction. Au lieu de s’émanciper à un moment charnière de son histoire, le langage et l'imaginaire de l’informatique ont été plaqués sur le vivant lors de la découverte de l’ADN. Les molécules incarnent des signaux reçus ou émis selon un programme génétique que l’on peut éditer. Les outils de la physique servent à l’étude d’une partie de corps (« hardware ») qui opère selon le code (« software ») qu’il véhicule. Le canard de Vaucanson se numérise, mais les métamorphoses permanentes du vivant demeurent des erreurs d’un mécanisme, importantes pour l’évolution. Ainsi, le prix Nobel de biologie en 2020 confère à sa discipline la capacité de « reprogrammer » le vivant et « de contrôler l’évolution ». La théorie biologique toujours en vigueur, bien qu’elle soit remise en question par de nombreuses observations, accepte cette affirmation péremptoire et erronée. En fait, nous traversons des crises biologiques et écologiques (chute de la biodiversité, insécurité alimentaire, résistances aux antibiotiques, abondance de perturbateurs endocriniens, épidémies d’épidémies, etc.) qui révèlent notre incapacité à comprendre les organismes vivants.\n\nL’exemple de la biologie montre la portée politique d’un manque de réflexivité en recherche. Une objectivité collective précieuse ne peut être constituée que par une science qui théorise, examine son épistémologie, connait son histoire et les conceptions philosophiques qu’elle embarque. Alors qu’elle doit constituer le cadre qui permet l’évaluation pharmakologique[^1]de techniques émergentes, la science promet aujourd’hui des « solutions » nano/géo/bio/psycho-technologiques, automatiquement adoptées si elles voient le jour. Or, la confiance dans le processus scientifique — et donc démocratique — des citoyens s’érode quand ils s’aperçoivent que les crises actuelles proviennent des « solutions » imposées hier sans débats. Dans la fuite en avant technologique d’un capitalisme repeint en vert, la recherche — qui la permet — doit porter un regard critique sur les connaissances qu’elle élabore. Plutôt que déserter la science, la question « Doit-on continuer la recherche scientifique ? » posée par Grothendiek en 1981 doit nous inviter à pænser la science de demain — libérée de son asservissement à la croissance économique. C’est un combat politique qui nécessite une exigence créative et un tâtonnement réfléchi au quotidien. \n\nComprendre le vivant au XXIe siècle sera crucial. La biologie doit assumer ses spécificités vis-à-vis de la physique en construisant sa propre épistémologie. Sur les épaules de penseurs contemporains qui ont souligné la nécessité d’une telle révolution ontologique, le conflit d’arguments empiriques et logiques doit faire rage. La rigueur scientifique ne réside pas dans la constance de principes implicites et intemporels, mais dans l’explicitation continue de ses règles évolutives. Le changement profond dont notre société a besoin se trouve une première fois dans ce travail. D’un point de vue opérationnel, une théorie des organismes enrayera notre « maladresse » destructrice du vivant, à entendre ici dans son sens le plus inclusif. \n\nSi les dernières décennies ont déconstruit beaucoup de nos croyances culturelles et montré leurs contingences, elles ont aussi souligné leur nécessité. Cependant, nous faisons face au vide conceptuel provoqué par le démantèlement des derniers refuges permettant des activités créatives (que ce soit en science, art ou philosophie). Nos fondations s’écroulent et nous ne sommes plus en mesure d’en construire de nouvelles. Outre des replis identitaires, des indifférences pathologiques ou des folies technosolutionnistes, la douce musique d’un nouvel animisme écologique nous invite à renier notre héritage de la modernité. Pouvons-nous seulement faire fi de notre histoire ? Cette solution a-t-elle des racines empirico-logique assez profondes pour éveiller un imaginaire collectif à la hauteur de celui qui meut actuellement un capitalisme qui détruit systématiquement toute organisation biologique et sociale ? L’histoire a montré que les mathématiques et la physique, toujours en dialogue avec la philosophie et les arts, ont eu une importance majeure dans l’émergence d’époques, car elles ont façonné des visions du monde. Une théorie des organismes aura comme deuxième fonction, en insufflant des idées radicalement nouvelles, des concepts rigoureux et puissants, de participer à la reconceptualisation de nos modes d’organisation et de notre rapport au monde.

The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism, but still resort to the invisible hand metaphor, for instance. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a \"commited\" and \"flexible\" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions \"stakeholders\" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research. \n\n\n\nTO READ FOR MISSION-ORIENTED. \n[Directorate-GeneralforResearchandInnovationEuropeanCommission2018](reference/Directorate-GeneralforResearchandInnovationEuropeanCommission2018.md)\n\n\n#### New Principles\n\nCreativité et affects.

Value is affect.\n\n\n\n###\n\nThis is the most fatalist aspect, because it points to the fact that each problem is automatically solved by the same solution. This solution is to resort to technological apparatus, which need to be designed by science. If scientists do rely on mechnaized protocoles, we would enter a new world where mechanized apparatus would have a very special status. In some way, this excludes the fade idea that they will dominate the World by rebelling and fighting humans. Instead, machines would have managed to autonomized their continued existence. By contaminating so deeply the noesis of human brains, they would have made them automatically resort to the same solution for solving the problems they had generated: do more of them. There is, in fact, a potential motor in the dialogical aspect of techologies — their pharmakon nature. Therefore, by using humans so deeply convinced that technologies are solutions — solely have a positive aspect — they would have find a way to autonomize their existence. \n\nAssuming that technologies can have a non beneficial aspect for humans (put a man out of work cannot be only and all the time positive, climate change, etc.). It suffice for machines to be in the hands of humans that think of them as solutions to conquer the World. \n\nMaking human societies automatically respond to their problem by machines is a way for them to self-renew and prosper. It does not matter if new scientific protocoles are constructed and adopted as long as they are protocoles, mechanized operations to construct technological apparatus. It is the automaticity of our response (building machines) in approaching problems that makes machines self-renew and exist.\n\nLet's take the point of view of machines. What would have them managed to do? They would have parasited human societies and use them to survive and prolifer. Let's understand them as a noetic specie. The idea of mechanism. Human would have generated dystopias, where they have human shapes and conquer the worldwith weapons that became out of control. With this picture humans could have externalize the threat and neglect that it was their own choice.\n\nWhat is a functionning part of societies? It is the part that make the machinary function. When saying that artists and philosopher do not contribute, it is understood that they do not contribute in making machines exists and sustain themselves. Even small salary jobs  are depreciated because they do not participate in making more machinesand automatic responses. Building strategies, protocoles, methods, coucils own to response, algorithms, technological apparatus, drugs, etc. Those are the jobs that pay. If you do not work for machines, you are not welcome in this society. \n\nIf we allow us to give some kind of substance for the \"mecanicist\" idea (with an extended definition) and call the idea Julia, then we will understand everything that we do is for Julia to self-renew, proliferate and prosper. We do this without thinking about it, such as cells in our bodies. Julia is always renewed and we replace each of its apparatus with a new one when damaged (such as cells in our bodies), we invent new things that has new functions for Julia. Julia generates our problems, but we automatically solve them by maintaining or replacing or  renewing Julia. Working for Julia is not a question and it done automatically, such as the proteins that  make a very impossible trajectory  but that do it still. Not working for Julia is depreciated in our society. Doing work for humans is not well seen: heal them, clean their place, taking care of them when their are useless (babies or old), feed them without Julia's standards. However, if you contribute in making Julia, you are weel accepted: algorithms (the best), making protocoles,  making machines, methodologies, detail steps.

Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:\n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)\n\nAccording to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). For this reason, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.\n\nThe proposed model can be summarized as follows. A finite set of economic actors are all inclined to consume or produce a different finite set of goods. This parametrizes their field of visions which need to overlap one another. The flexibility of prices are also parametrized (T1). The state of the system is described by the individual and variable consumption and production of goods and the variable price of the latters (T2). \n\nIn fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. \n\n\nConsumers can act by changing their relative consumption of goods depending on their personal inclinations and the variation of prices. Producters can alter the relative price of commodities depending on their varying capacity to produce them and the evolution of their consumption. The inclination to consume or produce is part of their personal \"knowledge\", reduced to a set of intrinsic parameters for each actor (T1). The access to the information of prices is also part of this intrinsic \"knowledge\". Prices channel information between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives instructions if one act so as to maximizes its own interest (T5). \n\nAlone, an economic actor does not receive the instruction of prices and does act on its state (T4).\n\nFor Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actor and posseses an extensive aspect (more sellers and consumers). For \"knowledge\" to be efficiently used, decentralization (or competition) should be maximized (T6) and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation.\n\nThis very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md). A detailed account for the limitations of similar models in economic can be found in ([Koppl2015](reference/Koppl2015.md)) and references therein. \n\n## Application to Polanyi's Republic of Science\n\n[literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md)\n\nIn the Republic of Science, scientists (T5) maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources (T1) — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve.\n\nWhen a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the dialogical scientific standards (plausability, scientific value, originality). The first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. \n\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. \n\nThe fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. \n\nThe dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too. \n\n The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion.

Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:\n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)\n\n#### Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes \nAccording to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 7) \n\nIn practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book *The Road to Serfdom* —, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.\n\n#### Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors\nHow, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 8) \n\nThe more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market _self-regulation_.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 10) \n\n\n#### The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)\nThe decentralized plans of _self-interested actors_ — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the _competition_ for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 11) \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- Knowledge cannot be reduced to digits. This echoes the informational metaphor in biology. It tends to consider negatively (as noise) everything that cannot be digitalized, here even reduced to a single number. See [literature note on Longo2012](note/literature%20note%20on%20Longo2012.md).\n- It takes Whitehead remark as a goal. \n- Everyone seems independent and does not rely on others. Individuals cannot influence themselves. No mimetism. \n- The market needs an exogeous cause to change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. In practice, external events perturbing the cost of one commodity do occur all the time so that everything happen _as if_ prices were evolving because commodities were traded.","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/note/literature-note-on-Henriques2013":{"title":"literature note on Henriques2013","content":"\n## **Policy-making in science policy: The ‘OECD model’ unveiled**     \nby Henriques L., Larédo P.

First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer: \n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003eIf governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. ([OECD1966](reference/OECD1966.md) , p.8)\n\nThis input/output continuous model being *de facto* extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good. \n\nSecond, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two blocs threats each other with nuclear weapon. There is a need for being able to plan research activities. \n\nThird, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md),[Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. The market cannot anticipate what is good for societies, such as research should be funded by public funds (this is also called 'market failure'). \n\n#### The OECD led the international transformation of science\nIn this context, and based on those arguments, the OECD changed its role, which so far consisted in sharing good practices and tested policies among its members.  It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S\u0026T led by a group of experts. The model it constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). \n\n#### The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth\nThe OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needssome fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate resources on specific research area. Accordingly, quantitative indicators must be developed to assess to quality of science and refine policies: this is the birth of the Frascati manual, still in used nowadays.  \n\n#### Comments\n\n- The linear model of science is incompatible with revolutions in science ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)). \n\n- This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions. It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity.

However, they share theoretical stances, collaborate and recognize each other with topics (chaos, network, emergence, etc.). Scientists are not specialists of complexity, they rather have a **dual role** and complexity appears on their CV in second or third position.

In a nutshell, it is rather a **scientific platform.** \n\n#### Complexity sciences rely on classical ontologies and epistemologies\nStructure of scientific argumentation rely on Ockham's razor, toy modeling, **statistics**, **mathematical modeling**, and proof of concept.

At the end of WW2 (and cryptography played a major role during this period), [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology that explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA.\n\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologits to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\nIt relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). This view directly eliminates the radical materiality of living organisms. For instance, Maynard Smith states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThere is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process (...) —  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n \n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n\n#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology\nMoreover, information is not well-defined for the living because it has ambiguous links with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](concept/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by Schrödinger ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)), it seems that organisms manage to \"resist\" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md).

Biomechanical forces (hemodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial ([Lucitti2007](reference/Lucitti2007.md), [Tang2004](reference/Tang2004.md), [Muller2003](reference/Muller2003.md), [Rot-Nikcevic2007](reference/Rot-Nikcevic2007.md), [Jakkaraju2003](reference/Jakkaraju2003.md)).  \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/note/literature-note-on-Montevil2021":{"title":"literature note on Montevil2021","content":"\n#### **Computational empiricism : the reigning épistémè of the sciences**     \nby Montevil M.

This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.\n\nReference: [Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)\n\n\n### Summary\n\n\n#### The IMRaD structure is about contextualizing a single unbiased observation to transform it to knowledge.\nIt is like adding a single brick on the cathedral of knowledge. The separation of results and discussion means that your mind is a virgin receptacle for information to flow inside. Then, you analyze the results that you have unbiasly seen. With the IMRaD format, scientists exchange information without being transformed (receptor, receiver). This is not theoretial thinking since the latter change how we think about phenomena. In fact, scientists do not have time to engage with specific ways to organize scientific rationality.\n\n#### Experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world, that is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from an interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon\n\nThere is a confusion between objectivity and automation. You can make something automatic with a deep unoticed theoretical commitment. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eprotocolization can also be counterproductive since it downplays the work of objectivation, that is to say, the articulation between procedures and theoretical thinking. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 5) \n\n\n#### The current épistémè still has a positivist influence\nThe scientific aim in the current épistémè is to find causal patterns or \"mechanisms\". Case studies or not considered, but they can give useful insights: the existence of one planet, the fact that something is possible, etc. The kind of knowledge that is looked for points to [scientific positivism](concept/scientific%20positivism.md). The épistémè builds on induction and is a kind of empiricism.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ecomputational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations. It cares for numerical questions (like statistics); however, it does not attend its logoi significantly, by analytical means or otherwise. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n#### Review articles contrast with original research in the current épistémè, except when statistical meta-analysis are performed\nAs review articles are typically required to be critical, the computational statistical analysis seems to considered more original then subjective critics. Review articles are requested by editors, which are often not researchers. With the massification and acceleration of scientific production, synthetic works should be valuable. They are not. However, theorization has a synthetic function.\n\n#### Modelling is specific to a phenomena, is not theoretical work and need to be included in a theoretical framework\nHowever, like in Planck's quanta case, it can be the starting point for a broader general framework. Most models are mathematical (and computational). They aim to imitate several properties with precision. Theoretical work confers a profound scientific meaning to the properties of models (Planck's quanta). Mathematical modelling is not theoretical work when it is local. When it results from a theoretical move, with original mathematical tools, it is then a part of theoritization. For instance, mathematical tools that originate from physics and transferred to biology convey implicit considerations. Models need to be included in a theoretical framework.\n\n#### Computational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations\nIt cares for numerical questions but do not attend for its logoi. Original works are empirical, generating data to analyze and reproducing them with models. In empirical works, the approach is inductive although statistical Popperian tests are usually conducted. In computational models, the ability to fit empirical data prevail on theoretical consistency or significance.\n\n\n#### The épistémè has some links with the organization of science\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eComputational empiricism is an industrialization of research activity, a paradoxical notion considering that research is about bringing new, singular insights. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis organization goes with a cumulative view of science, where productivism is a natural aim. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n#### Computational empiricism produces a state of theory disruption\nMontévil name the current épistémè _computational empiricism_. Most scientists adopt an _inductive_ approach: they generate data, analyze them and/or try to reproduce them using specific models. The analysis are predominantly statistical tests and mathematical models primarly aim at imitation. They are carried out on computers and the theoretical meaning they bear is usually not discussed. Two observations point to a _cumulative_ view of knowledge. First, the standardization of the publication structure, which contextualize a single unbiased observation to communicate an easy-to-find information to other scientists. Second, synthetic works taking place in critical and editor-ordered review articles are explicitely not considered to be original contributions unless they undertake computational meta-analysis. Finally, in the spirit of Bernard Stielger, the author diagnozed a phenomena he calls _theory disruption_, defined as follow:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn a somewhat perverse way, it also promotes empirical results that destabilize former theoretical frameworks because they catch attention. However, it does not promote rethinking these frameworks, leading to what may be called a theory disruption that is more or less advanced depending on the fields —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n### Comments\nSee also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) — Chapter Theorie and methods.

(2019)         \nOECD      \n\nReference: [Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)\n\nThe neoliberal era of science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) herits from a organization of Science that already has some internal contradictions. It will change it by several political reforms, led by the OECD. First, some aspects are retained or slightly modified. Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs. The linear model is modified to include \"tacit knowledge\" (another idea of Polanyi). For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. Despite the strong trend in public-private collaboration, more is \"strongly encouraged\".  \n\n\nThe major shift is that the governement should no longer plan what science should do. It should follow what \"stakeholders\" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain, public and private sector. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eCommitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) \n\nIn Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processing software and filtering out the majority by an unknown proecss, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the \"ivory tower\" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life. Government should be *flexible* because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficcient (i.e. all the problems raised by Hayek). \n\nThe second shift is about the design of \"mission-oriented\" policies to solve grand societal challenges, top-down initiatives responding \"to the needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support\".  \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis is meant to generate increased motivation among the actors – beyond remuneration and academic recognition, the awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause is an incentive for surpassing oneself —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 32) \n\nThe rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councis/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon. \n\n\u003e[!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eTo engage people. Make them part of the process. And proud to be European. Mark Zuckerberg talked about feeling part of something bigger in a recent speech. He was referring to a well-known story about John F Kennedy.

And the janitor responded: “Mr President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That’s the kind of purpose I’m referring to. — ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/))\n\nSubjects of \"mission-oriented\" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality \"rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance (...)\". \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe large number of instruments and programmes available in most of the strategies studied makes it difficult for users to navigate among them and increases the risk of duplication. Rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance, reduce administrative costs (for participants and programme administrators), and maximise the impact of the strategy put in place. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) \n\n\n\n \n#### Comments \n\nWhose money? Public money, citizens. Who decides? Stakeholders, that is citizens and the private sector — the state should not interfere, only to be \"vigilant\".  This is the market of ideas. Offer and demand. Consumers are citizens and the private sector. However, the money comes citizens. The private sector does not invest whatsoever in this mechanism. They only ask which directions to pursue annd use the fruit of research. \n\nWe go back to a market system, but this is not at the scale of Polanyi. Scientists are sellers that respond to the demand of public/industrials.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n- Do citizens really decide? \n\nThe role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented.  It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal. \n\n- Can stakeholders know what is good for them ? \n\nThe market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want. However, there is no problem, \"should be monitored vigilantly by governments\".  It does not, it is incompatible [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). \n\nIn any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV? (such as the meaning of \"islamo-gauchism\"). *The scientific activity is against the doxa.* \n\n#### Idea \n\n\n\n- La confiance entre scientifiques et la population est ébranlée parce que ces derniers, sous la pression de publier, se mettent à faire jouer les \"commercial morals\" (c'est à dire, mon papier est bon car il est accepté). Dès lors, il découle une énorme crise de reproductibilité et la plupart des choses qui en sorte ne sont pas fiable.  Ils vendent des choses fragiles et font des énormes promesses. \n\n- Credit import recherche de plus en plus grand pour moins de recherche. \n\n- La tour d'ivoire est crée par le simple fait de différencier les scientifiques des citoyens. Les sccientifiques sont des citoyens et eds humains qui ont des pensées qui reflètent en partie ceux de la société. La tour d'ivoir est illusoire, elle fait comme-ci ces dderniers étaient neutres et objecctifs, près à travailler sur les sujets qu'on leur pointe du doigts. \n\n- Innovation is technological, aims at economic growth, and can only impact societies positively.

(1962)         \n*Minerva* 1: 54-73       \nDOI: 10.1007/BF01101453     \n\nReference: [Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)\n\n\n#### Background\n\nMicheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of *tacit knowledge* will be used by the OECD later. \n\nIn the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. \n\n\n##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. \nPolanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1].\n\nWhile Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).\n\n##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards\nHowever, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:\n\n1.  Plausibility\n2.  Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.\n3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists\n\n##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. \n\n##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science\nMoreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.\n- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.\n- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2]. \n\n\u003e[!warning]\n\u003e \n\u003eNeoliberalism was not the dominant ideology in the Western world at that time. The Republic of Science is more related to a liberal view of science, in the classical view, without state intervention. Sixty years later, we find an era of neoliberalism in science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)), but this has nothing to do with what is suggested here. \n\n- Idea of enablement. \n\n[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.\n[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/note/marketization_of_scientific_research":{"title":"marketization_of_scientific_research","content":"\nThis uses concepts that can be found in: \n[literature note on Paic2019](note/literature%20note%20on%20Paic2019.md)\n[literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)\n[literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md)\n[literature note on Henriques2013](note/literature%20note%20on%20Henriques2013.md)\n\nWe gives five caracteristics of the marketization and industrialisation of research. \n\n#### Exogeous cause prevail on endogeous one\nWhen Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)) emphasizes that the \"continued existence\" of Science depends on its \"self-renewal\", he points to the fact that the research entreprise for societies does not need an exogeous cause to evolve. In contrast, market needs one (an \"accident\" to which to  react) to change its prices ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)). Once the market has operated those changes, prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. Making research activities offer respond to external demand is a first characteristic of marketisation.  When ending a project, we usually have unresolved questions. However, they never have been so clear and we are convinced that they are good questions. Whitin this respect, we can consider that asking relevant questions is one of the central capacity of a researcher. However, scientists can lose their capacity to design original research projects, if they are not accepted.  The loss of the capacity to design original research projects, because this role has been conferred to the market mecanisms. In this process, the art of identifying and expliciting relevant scientific directions is externalized and assured automatically to make the scientific offer meet \"stakeholders\" demand ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). The latter stem from an average of concerns[^1] at a given time, which is constituated by a protocole and takes the form of a \"mission-oriented\" project. This transfer of know-how to a mechanized machinary corresponds Marx's idea of proletarization ([Marx2005](reference/Marx2005.md)), extended to the capacity to design following Stielger ([Stiegler2012](reference/Stiegler2012.md), [Alombert2021](reference/Alombert2021.md)). From a larger perspective, this is loss begins with the introduction of competitive project-based fundings that indirectly drive the elaboration of projects towards predefined directions. \n\nA word a \"mission-oriented\".\n \n\n\u003e[!warning]\n\u003e\n\u003e + automaticity of design (taking the mean, no commitment, disruption du second order, entropy, [Longo2013](reference/Longo2013.md) \"common sense\", (Stielger,montévil,Bifurquer). Disruption du second order.\n\u003e + Real role of citizens and \"Ivory towel\". Credit impot research, end of research for mutinational, pillage des fonds publics.  [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). \n\n\n#### Smith's inert employee principle prevail upon Merton's irreducible curiosity momentum\nPrinciples frame how we understand phenomena. In *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith posits the equivalent of Gallileo's inertial principle: \"It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can, (...)\" ([Smith1887](reference/Smith1887.md)). This principle is framing capitalism, because it implies that people are lazy and that they work if and only if they are paid ([Schwartz2015](reference/Schwartz2015.md)). In contrast, Merton posited another principle for research: \"the pursuit of science is culturally defined as being primarily a disinterested search for truth and only secondarily, a means of earning a livelihood.\" ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). Merton therefore acknowledge a principled momentum due to curiosity. We can also including Polanyi's reference to scientific standards (originality within the rules). Depending which principle about human nature is adopted, science policies change and the vocabulary with it.  In one case, the \"scientific workforce\" is given \"incentives\" to which it \"responds\". Researchers do not ask interesting enough questions and one must prompt them to take more risks ([OECD2021a](reference/OECD2021a.md)). Management practices come into play to maximize productivity such that the \"awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause\" make them \"proud of being European\" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/)), \"an incentive for surpassing oneself\" ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). On the other hand, adopting the second principle, it is acknowledged that research is grounded in human's curiosity. Therefore, science policies would reflect on how to maintain this curiosity productive, be it by encouraging specific lifestyles and advise against other (such as too much work), reflect on how researchers collaborate, etc. \n\n\n#### Symmetrization of individuals and consequences for distinguishing\nIn biographies, we depict scientists (a fortiori famous one such as Einstein, Bohr, Curie) as being original, excentric, not playing by the rules, within a real specificity etc. On the other hand, the scientific workforce does not refer to this. In this view, the scientific \"workforce\" is commutable, discoveries do not depend on specific researchers. This focus the attention on the quantitative aspect of research such as the concentration of elementary and identical — or unidimensionallized (good or bad) depending on the output rate — scientists in specific domains. This builds on the dominant positivist philosophy in Science that consider their subjectivity as a noise when probing the natural world. This loss of individuality is translated in impersonal format of scientific articles, in the name of objectivity. The structure of scientific articles (IMRaD) contextualize a single unbiased observation to transform it into knowledge. They gather easy-to-find informations to communicate more efficiently ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). This reveals a cumulative view of knowledge — already present in Polanyi's puzzle metaphor —  and points to a market-like communication of information. In contrast, experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world. It is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from a subjective interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon. Also, using the informational language implies that the receiver and the emeter are left unchanged during the process. This is absolutely not the goal in research, where one should be at least in part surprised in reading articles.\n\nOnce, they are all the same, how to distinguish them? By merit. \nSimilar individuals that compete with one another, resorting to individualism and \"commercial morals\". \nPeculiar and heterogeneous individuals collaborating with each other to produce robust scientific knowledge. \nThey are all self-interested agents.\n\nIndividualism and \"commercial morals\" instead of collaboration are consequences of symmetrization\n\nResearch make sense only as a collective work and one's work always builds on others. In this tradition, the \"mutual adjustement of independent initiative\" stage actors that are \"self-interested\" only to a given extent, because the work they produce is by construction dedicated to other researchers ([Chavalarias2020a](reference/Chavalarias2020a.md)). As division of labor prevail upon overlapping neighborhoods, researchers compete to publish for a third party (*concurrence*), and not for themselves (*complementary* or *antagonism*). In a way, less attention is provided to the robustness of the results, pedagogy, plausibility of promises ([Audetat2015](reference/Audetat2015.md)), reproducibility ([Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md)) or even integrity ([Fang2012](reference/Fang2012.md), [Edwards2017](reference/Edwards2017.md)). Bibliometrics index and other tools to create artificial competition have unsurprinsingly confirmed Goodhart's law ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)). In fact, Merton ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)) already predicted that competion beyond the \"natural\" linear regime — i.e. competition to get the priority of a discovery for reputation — deteriorates science. Despite policy makers willing to instaure a climate of \"Darwinian selection\" bewteen scientists ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)), evidences linking a lower quality of science due to, for instance, rushing keep cropping up ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Yong2018](reference/Yong2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)). The process of fostering individualism and egoism also relate the neoliberal market spirit in research, through the concept of \"commercial morals\" ([Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)). In a word, it relates to the pitfall of self-evaluating your research based on the rationale that \"my scientific production is good *because* it is accepted by journals\". Making good research is then assimilated to the capacity of getting your papers accepted in specific journals. In a market system, where there is \"a moral justification for selfishness (...)\" ([Hayek1979](reference/Hayek1979.md)), this behavior would indeed (supposedly) participates in building the greater good. In fact, economists of science tackle fraud from a purely individualistic perspective by evaluating risks/benefits ratio[^2]. Following this line, \"selling your research\" is an activity that is encouraged in order to convince researchers or journals by all means. Such practices (oversimplification, omission, camouflage, etc.) can only harm the collective scientific activity in the long-term. \n\n#### Taylor's division of labour prevail upon Polanyi's overlapping neigbourhood (separability)\nOverlapping neighborhood ensure shared expertise on a specific subject. It is the place where the authority of scientific standards is ensured and where critical thinking takes place. In fact, we can understand the peer review process described by Polanyi's scientific standards, with Morin's dialogical principle, that is the association of two complementary, antagonistic and competitive logics (conformism and dissent here). Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity that cannot be reduced to mere juxtaposition of the two. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. When modifying the dialogical nature of the scientific standards by defining a third criteria such as relevance with respect to societal needs, the complementary aspect and the *antagonism* (*anta* which is face-to-face and *agônisma*, struggle) no longer play a role. Efforts are canalized within the third heteronome aspect that solely permit *competition* (*concurrence*, *concourir* in french), a race toward the same objective. This effect can certainly be related to the \"epistemic drift\" described in ([Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md)). This semantic turn allows us to articulate a regime of theoretical disputes for the best arguments on common subjects to a regime where free competition gives you the liberty to isolate yourself from existing competition. This allows you to create a new specific field, far from competition to optimize your chance of having the priority over a discovery ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). According to Morin, the most fundamental condition for science to exists lies: \"what must be absolutly safeguarded is the conflictual plurality in a game that obeys empirico-logical rules\" ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md), p. 24). We should understand Morin's idea not only as a sufficient but also necessary condition. When this \"epistemic drift\" becomes important, the overlapping neighborhood area decreases and we enter a regime of division of labour, that is \"scientific\" organization of reasearch. The allocation of grants will be \"optimize\" in order to avoid \"risk of duplication\" and 'limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). \n\n*Everything happens like if, under the requirement of participating to at least one match of a infinite box competition, you allowed the possibility of chosing the referee position. You are no longer guaranteed that matches still take place.* In fact, the need to argue and defend you research requires the need to reflect about it. You need to find arguments. Having an adversory prompts you to prepare, look in the history of science, see that others  points of view exists, fix you non-scientifiic ideas about it, etc. \nThe separation between philosophy and science swepping out reflexivity from the scientific activity. Scientific disciplines have a long history, they use specific methods and rely on metaphysical assumptions. Elementary history and philosophy of science helps in replacing the scientific activity for the cultural \"tradition\" it is, gaining intellectual hygiene against the believe of creating the sacred and universal Truth. Moreover, theoretical thinking is a crucial activity that play a central role in science, specifically when renewing fields of research. Theories defines observables how phenomena that require explanation ([Longo2016](reference/Longo2016.md)). The \"self-renewal\" of disciplines depends on this reflexive and critical activity, whose down side is to have a low productivity compared to empirical approaches. Biology ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)) and psychological sciences ([Muthukrishna2019](reference/Muthukrishna2019.md)) are both experiencing important such problems. An industrialized research jeopardize its existence by focysing on productivity, neglecting theoretical thinking. The partition of science, without theoretical controversies, does not encourage reflexivity, and that can leave fields in state of *theory disruption*, as recently suggested ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). \n\n\n#### Automaticity is automatically the mean and the goal of research  \nThe so-called \"linear model for innovation\" (or its new extension that encourages to blur those frontiers) relates the pathway from research to technologies: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear chain extends to economic growth. \n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003eIf governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. ([OECD1966](reference/OECD1966.md) , p.8)\n\nIf the goal of the scientific enterprise is growth and international competitivity since the 60's — which it still is ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)) —, research *de facto* aims at building technologies since then. To justify such a goal, OECD S\u0026T policy makers maintain a unambiguous and therefore naive view of technology. For instance, a long policy paper on robots concludes that \"Progress in robotics will help to make life easier, richer and healthier.\" ([Nolan2021](reference/Nolan2021.md)). From this perspective, all technologies are good, an opinion that seems to remain valid in the new \"responsible innovation\" paradigm ([Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)). Making automatons (e.g. machines, programs, protocoles, etc.) is therefore the unquestionned long-term goal of science. This drives basic research to look for mechanisms in nature. Also, this encourages saving only the operational part of theories. From *logos*, they become *techné* ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md), [Stiegler2021](reference/Stiegler2021.md)). The intensive trend for the protocolization of research (usually to make it more reproducible) hide the automatic adoption of unknown black-box tools and can therefore reduce theoretical thinking. This confusion between objectivity and automaticity also reveals itself in the important synthetic process of review articles, which are not qualified as original research, except when computational meta-analysis are performed ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). Last but not least, a infinitly powerful artifical intelligence making correlations will not replace the work of scientists ([Calude2017](reference/Calude2017.md)), despite the willing of ([Anderson2008](reference/Anderson2008.md)) and others inclined to this pervasive idea. \n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: Another possibility that is not considered by policy makers and that would be different from this averaging is to take random directions from citizens or industrials. However, the pertinence of such directions is doubtious. \n[^2]: The realistic validity of such models is of course doubtious when they conclude that the \"publish-or-perish\" paradigm *reduce* misconduct.

Novelties refer\nFor instance, we know the notes of a new music. We know the colors of a new painting. \nWe are not surprised by the material composition, as if we were told its composition, we would not be surprised at all. \n\"The painter used a frame of 40x40, the color blue, the chord F#\". \nArtisitic is a sort of composition of elements. (Poincaré). No material elements is created (due to principles of physics). \nHowever, we can assemble things so that to create something new. What is new, then ?\nThis is not a mere materialistic assemblage, because we have just stated that no one would be surprise to learn that the artists used this color, make this shape, used this musical pattern, etc.\nIn fact, given a two dimensionnal shape (let's say square shape), we could actually draw all possible paintings, all photos. Of course, technique of paintings may be important, the texture, etc. Suppose that we can generate any colors on a 4k sceen, and -let's take some advance— we can also generate any \"texture\" on this screen. The paintings of Raphaël or just one of all the possible picture we can generate. Does it mean that nobody would no longer draw something new? \nThere is something strange here, as Bergson pointed out. Is it the same thing to define generically a painting (with material considerations ?)\n\nLet's now reduce the problem to a more concrete one :  the chess game. I'm not assuming that chess is an art, but we will be able to understand some crucial aspects with it. I'm assuming that the reader knows the principle of the game. How would you play if you were to begin? How did you play the first time? Somebody told you the rules. Each  time the turn was yours, you would eventuallly try all possibilities and evaluate if it were good or bad moves. Would you believe someone telling you that you can do new things in chess ? Not really.\nHow come professional chess players can say that somedy invented something or created a new move? After all, such as for painting, there is no surprise in chess, there is a finite (and particularly low) number of move at each step. All games can be written down by a machine. We can even think of a big book that write all chess games down. How then, could someone dare say that he invented something when there is a book that has already written down its novelty? How does an artist dare to say that it has created a new image when when it is already stored on a large server somewhere? All music have already been produced, on the next server. \n\nThis is because novelty should always be understood with respect to a specific context. \nA professional chess player will tell you that, to play, he does not evaluate all moves: he only considers the good ones (at middle of the game). \nHe does not consider the bad ones. Then he rapidly chooses between the two or three moves that he only considders. You try 20 of them. \nTherefore, everything happens as if she was choosing (among three of four move) that are the only viable move, to him.\nFrom all pre-possiblities, she restricted real possiblities by a holistic evaluation of the board.\nFrom where this space of possibilities reduction come from? \n\nThe implicit reduction of possibilities is possible only thanks to a specific context, that can only be understood thanks to the history of the player.\nHere, history refers to the training of the chess professional that plays a crucial role in reducing the space of possibilities.\nTo understand this space of possibilities, you will need to understand the physical individual, how it works in its current environment, but also its history in it environment. Those space of possibilities are therefore highly specific to the individual.\n\nIn fact, in chess, the game is so simple and the moves so restricted that all professional players think about practically the same things. What is a novelty then? A novelty is something outside the implicit space of possibilities, but that can be adopted within. It was therefore a priori excluded and seemed impossible. A novelty is specific to individuals, but if they share and explicit to themselves their similar space of possibilities, they would agree about what is new.\n\nDoes A.I. can be creative? Can A.I. produce a novelty? First, if you give the machine all moves that were done by humans, you will see no novelty. What about supervized learning? We first need to define what is the implicit space of possibilities for a machine. If we understand it as the result that it will return during the learning process, then it will itself produce novelties by trials and errors. Such as a human making a random move on a board and evaluate it afterwards. There is a very thin chance that it discovers a novelty that he will adopts, but after millions of try, it is possible. This is what the A.I. does, however it need rules. \n\nChess players find some moves they find interesting in chess games between computers. They are novelties (to them). Therefore, humans, thanks to A.I. can be better at chess, because it opens new possibilities. But, chess is easy because there are explicit mathematical rules. The outcome is \"winning\" or not. This is not art. A machine can easily learn how to play perfectly the game. In fact, the pre-possibility space is very small. \n\nIn art, there are no rules and the pre-possibility is so large and outcome so nuanced that machine will never be able to explore possibilities for us. \"Rules\" evolve, which means that there are no fixed rules like in physics. How would you define possiblities?\n\nWhat does Midjourney do? It generates pictures that ressembles existing ones. It will be able to find patterns that are outside what we thought to be art. For instance, it needs to find shapes, theses are the rules it constructs for itself. It finds rules according to previous pictures and generate something that might be outside what could be thought in our culture. However, art does not reduce to materialistic considerations, can you sum up a piece of art to its materialistic aspect? Of course not and this is what Marcel Duchamp understood. How can you think about something that retrieves a materialistic aspect but is not computable? Numeric images can all be computed, paintings all be drawn. What does it say about our history? What does it say about who we are? We have done everything not to do something. What cannot be generated on a computer or a machine ?\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Alombert2021":{"title":"Alombert2021","content":"\n#### **Vocabulaire de l’Internation: Introduction aux concepts de Bernard Stiegler et du collectif Internation**     \nby Alombert A., Krzykawski M.

According to these scientists, competition contributes to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage of others’ ability to use one’s work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct. When competition is pervasive, such effects may jeopardize the progress, efficiency and integrity of science.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Anderson2008":{"title":"Anderson2008","content":"\n#### **The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete**     \nby Anderson C.

As a first step, we raise several questions with regard to the possibility of ‘responsible’ innovation and point at several difficulties which undermine the supposedly responsible character of innovation processes, based on an analysis of the input, throughput and output of innovation processes. It becomes clear that the practical applicability of the concept of responsible innovation is highly problematic and that a more thorough inquiry of the concept is required. As a second step, we analyze the concept of innovation which is self-evidently presupposed in current literature on responsible innovation. It becomes clear that innovation is self-evidently seen as (1) technological innovation, (2) is primarily perceived from an economic perspective, (3) is inherently good and (4) presupposes a symmetry between moral agents and moral addressees. By challenging this narrow and uncritical concept of innovation, we contribute to a second round of theorizing about the concept and provide a research agenda for future research in order to enhance a less naïve concept of responsible innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Boolos2007":{"title":"Boolos2007","content":"\n#### **Computability and Logic**     \nby Boolos G.S., Burgess J.P., Jeffrey R.C.

Yes, the owner will say, the vessel is not its planks but the relationship between them. Similarly, Antoine Danchin argues in this provocative book, life itself is not revealed just by its components--DNA, ribosomes, genes, cells--but also by their relationships. By the end of 2001, almost 500 genome programs were completed or under way. Drawing upon what researchers worldwide are learning from the gene sequences of bacteria, plants, fungi, fruit flies, worms, and humans, Danchin shows us how genomes are far more than mere collections of genes. They are the means of transmitting the system of relationships making up a living cell from one generation to the next. Genomes are codes that govern the construction, operation, and survival of cells. The Delphic Boat shows us that life is both a complicated piece of chemical machinery that decodes genomes and a process that builds this machinery. The laws of physics or chemistry can only predict so much of this process. To truly understand life, we must understand spatial and temporal relationships between molecules that make up the cell, and how these molecules are coordinated. Danchin persuades us that if we can reach this level of understanding of genomes, we will be able to resolve the major biological puzzle of the twenty-first century: the enigma of the living machine that creates the living machine.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Davies2006":{"title":"Davies2006","content":"\n#### **The Rise and Fall of the Neo-liberal University**     \nby Davies B., Gottsche M., Bansel P.

Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Elzinga1997":{"title":"Elzinga1997","content":"\n#### **The science-society contract in historical transformation: with special reference to “epistemic drift”**     \nby Elzinga A.

It is argued that the broadening of the Kuhnian concept of the paradigm, making it amenable to science policy studies, was an important move. Further development of this notion, however, standed on the prongs of critique coming from both the worlds of politics and science. At the same time, advances in the cognitive sociology of science undermined the internalist/externalist distinction. Today, with certain changes in the conditions of research due to the introduction of the concept of ?strategic research?, politicians are more apt to accept certain points of the thesis; scientific communities, on the other hand, perceive new threats to their autonomy. This paper tries to make sense of this new situation by translating the question of interplay between internal and external dynamics of research into one involving boundary management and epistemic criteria. The notion of ?epistemic drift? is introduced and the internalist/externalist distinction refurbished in neo-institutionalist terms, making use of the concept of interfoliating credibility cycles.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Estrada2013":{"title":"Estrada2013","content":"\n#### **Graph and Network Theory in Physics.

However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart’s Law, according to which, “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Results In this study, we analyzed \u003e120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal’s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of \u003e2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Fischer2009":{"title":"Fischer2009","content":"\n#### **Michael Polanyi's Republic of Science: The Tacit Dimension**     \nby Fischer F., Mandell A.

Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay, ‘The Republic of Science’. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the tacit dimension in knowledge formation—or what he described as ‘personal knowledge’. On the one hand, his political essay supports a classical conservative position, while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's own ‘fiduciary community’—in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Society—shaped his theoretical conceptualization of the so-called ‘republic of science’. In this way, Polanyi's political contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political thought.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Fodor1974":{"title":"Fodor1974","content":"\n#### **Special Sciences (Or: The Disunity of Science as a Working Hypothesis)**     \nby Fodor J.F.

(2020)         \n\n**Abstract**:  This paper investigates how competition to publish ﬁrst and thereby establish priority impacts the quality of scientiﬁc research. We begin by developing a model where scientists decide whether and how long to work on a given project. When deciding how long to let their projects mature, scientists trade oﬀ the marginal beneﬁt of higher quality research against the marginal risk of being pre-empted. The most important (highest potential) projects are the most competitive because they induce the most entry. Therefore, the model predicts these projects are also the most rushed and lowest quality. We test the predictions of this model in the ﬁeld of structural biology using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for structures of large macromolecules. An important feature of the PDB is that it assigns objective measures of scientiﬁc quality to each structure. As suggested by the model, we ﬁnd that structures with higher ex-ante potential generate more competition, are completed faster, and are lower quality. Consistent with the model, and with a causal interpretation of our empirical results, these relationships are mitigated when we focus on structures deposited by scientists who – by nature of their employment position – are less focused on publication and priority.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Holton1975":{"title":"Holton1975","content":"\n#### **On the Role of Themata in Scientific Thought**     \nby Holton G.

The aim of the present article is to analyze the epistemological status attributed in the science of complexity to several fundamental ideas, such as those of scientific law, objectivity, and prediction. The aim is to show that the hope of superseding reductionism by means of concepts such as that of “emergence” is fallacious and that the science of complexity proposes forms of reductionism that are even more restrictive than the classical ones, particularly when it claims to unify in a single treatment problems that vary widely in nature such as physical, biological, and social problems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Jakkaraju2003":{"title":"Jakkaraju2003","content":"\n#### **Role of stretch in activation of smooth muscle cell lineage**     \nby Jakkaraju S., Zhe X., Schuger L.

Thus, there are no entailing laws of economic dynamics. In this sense, economic dynamics are creative and the economy is not a causal system. Because economic dynamics are creative, the implicit frame of analysis for the econosphere changes in unprestatable and non-algorithmic ways. New-venture, social, and political entrepreneurs solve the frame problem of the econosphere. Economic evolution is unpredictable, not entailed, and the number of things traded (‘cambiodiversity’) increases over time. Our metatheoretic framework points out how institutions, entrepreneurs, and disparate actors enable what we call ‘novelty intermediation’. We provide examples of novelty intermediation from Rennaissance Italy to Silicon Valley.

The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/LiVigni2021":{"title":"LiVigni2021","content":"\n#### **Histoire et sociologie des sciences de la complexité**     \nby Li Vigni F.

The elaboration of theoretical principles is examined in the light of the rich interactions between physics and mathematics. These two disciplines share common principles of construction of concepts and of the proper objects of inquiry. Theory construction in physics relies on mathematical symmetries that preserve the key invariants observed and proposed by such theory; these invariants buttress the idea that the objects of physics are generic and thus interchangeable and they move along specific trajectories which are uniquely determined, in classical and relativistic physics., In contrast to physics, biology is a historical science that centers on the changes that organisms experience while undergoing ontogenesis and phylogenesis. Biological objects, namely organisms, are not generic but specific; they are individuals. The incessant changes they undergo represent the breaking of symmetries, and thus the opposite of symmetry conservation, a central component of physical theories. This instability corresponds to the changes of the environment and the phenotypes., Inspired by Galileo’s principle of inertia, the “default state” of inert matter, we propose a “default state” for biological dynamics following Darwin’s first principle, “descent with modification” that we transform into “proliferation with variation and motility” as a property that spans life, including cells in an organism. These dissimilarities between theories of the inert and of biology also apply to causality: biological causality is to be understood in relation to the distinctive role that constraints assume in this discipline. Consequently, the notion of cause will be reframed in a context where constraints to activity are seen as the core component of biological analyses. Finally, we assert that the radical materiality of life rules out distinctions such as “software vs. hardware.”\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Longo2021":{"title":"Longo2021","content":"\n#### **Programming Evolution: A Crack in Science**     \nby Longo G.

Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a-/-). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood. These data show that hemodynamic force is necessary and sufficient to induce vessel remodeling in the mammalian yolk sac.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Marx2005":{"title":"Marx2005","content":"\n#### **Grundrisse: Foundations of the critique of political economy**     \nby Marx K.

The core of the argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination: biological organisation determines itself in the sense that the effects of its activity contribute to determine its own conditions of existence. We suggest that not any kind of circular regime realises self-determination, which should be speciﬁcally understood as self-constraint: in biological systems, in particular, selfconstraint takes the form of closure, i.e. a network of mutually dependent constitutive constraints. We then explore the occurrence of intrinsic teleology in the biological domain and beyond. On the one hand, the organisational account might possibly concede that supra-organismal biological systems (as symbioses or ecosystems) could realise closure, and hence be teleological. On the other hand, the realisation of closure beyond the biological realm appears to be highly unlikely. In turn, the occurrence of simpler forms of self-determination remains a controversial issue, in particular with respect to the case of self-organising dissipative systems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Muller2003":{"title":"Muller2003","content":"\n#### **Embryonic motility: environmental influences and evolutionary innovation**     \nby Müller G.B.

Two concepts are introduced to describe the physical regularity of macromolecular evolution: sequence space and quasi-species. Natural selection means localization of a mutant distribution in sequence space. This localized distribution, called the quasi-species, is centered around a master sequence (or a degenerate set), that the biologist would call the wild-type. The self-ordering of such a system is an essential consequence of its formation through self-reproduction of its macromolecular consti tuents, a process that in the dynamical equations expresses itself by positive diagonal coefficients called selective values. The theory describes how population numbers of wild type and mutants are related to the distribution of selective values, that is to say, how value topography maps into population topography. For selectively (nearly) neutral mutants appearing in the quasi- species distribution, population numbers are greatly enhanced as compared to those of disadvantageous mutants, even more so in continuous domains of such selectively valuable mutants. As a consequence, mutants far distant from the wild type may occur because they are produced with the help of highly populated, less distant precursors. Since values are cohesively distributed, like mountains on earth, and since their positions are multiply connected in the high-dimensional sequence space, the overpopulation of (nearly) neural mutants provides guidance for the evolutionary process. Localization in sequence space, subject to a threshold in the fidelity of reproduction, is steadily challenged until an optimal state is reached. The model has been designed according to experimentally determined properties of self-replicating molecules. The conclusions reached from the theoretical models can be used to construct machines that provide optimal conditions for the evolution of functional macromolecules.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Polanyi1962":{"title":"Polanyi1962","content":"\n#### **The Republic of science**     \nby Polanyi M.

(1944)         \nCambridge University Press      \n\n**Abstract**:  Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger's What is Life? is one of the great science classics of the twentieth century. A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-12T13:05:44.902550136Z","tags":null},"/reference/Schwartz2015":{"title":"Schwartz2015","content":"\n#### **Why we work**     \nby Schwartz B.
