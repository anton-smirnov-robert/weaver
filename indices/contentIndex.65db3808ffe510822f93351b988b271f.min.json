He pictures not a mecanism but a person — “Turing's architect” according to ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)) Turing introduced ([Turing1936](reference/Turing1936.md)) this machine trying to answer questions regarding decidability. A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers. It requires a (readable, writtable, and movable) infinite 1D bit register — a tape. Turing has shown that those elementary instructions are enough to do elaborate any sophisticated program that are themselves encoded on the tape. The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded. The operating system read the instructions as it computes the program and change the input binary string. Increasing the complexity of the machine (e.g. alphabet, dimensions) does not change the class of functions it can computes ([recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)s). \n\n\n#### Details \n\n**What is the formal definition of a Turing machine ?** \nThe alphabet of the tape $\\Gamma$ can be thought to be 0's and 1's and blank's. \n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\text { A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, }\\left(Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, q_{0}, q_{\\text {accept }}, q_{\\text {reject }}\\right) \\text {, where } \\\\ Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma \\text { are all finite sets and } \\\\ \\text { 1. } Q \\text { is the set of states, } \\\\ \\text { 2. } \\Sigma \\text { is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol } \\sqcup \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 3. } \\Gamma \\text { is the tape alphabet, where } \\sqcup \\in \\Gamma \\text { and } \\Sigma \\subseteq \\Gamma \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 4. } \\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\longrightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times\\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\} \\text { is the transition function, } \\\\ \\text { 5. } q_{0} \\in Q \\text { is the start state, } \\\\ \\text { 6. } q_{\\text {accept }} \\in Q \\text { is the accept state, and } \\\\ \\text { 7. } q_{\\text {reject }} \\in Q \\text { is the reject state, where } q_{\\text {reject }} \\neq q_{\\text {accept }}\\end{array}$$\n\n**How to write the program (or diagram or table of instructions) in the machine ?**\n\nWe write $S_0=blank$ , $S_1=0$ and $S_2=1$, $R=move \\ right$, $L= move \\ left$ . \nAn instruction can be written $q_i S_i S_j R q_m$  or  $q_i S_i S_j L q_m$.

De cette conception émane une épistémologie adaptée à l’étude de la matière inerte. La biologie, sous forte influence de la physique, peine à se démarquer de la discipline faite reine par construction. Au lieu de s’émanciper à un moment charnière de son histoire, la biologie a plaqué le langage et l'imaginaire de l’informatique sur le vivant lors de la découverte de l’ADN. Les molécules incarnent des signaux reçus ou émis selon un programme génétique que l’on peut éditer. Les outils de la physique servent à l’étude d’une partie de corps (« hardware ») qui opère selon le code (« software ») qu’il véhicule. Le canard de Vaucanson se numérise, mais les métamorphoses permanentes du vivant demeurent des erreurs d’un mécanisme, importantes pour l’évolution. Ainsi, le prix Nobel de biologie en 2020 confère à sa discipline la capacité de « reprogrammer » le vivant et « de contrôler l’évolution ». La théorie biologique toujours en vigueur, bien qu’elle soit remise en question par de nombreuses observations, accepte cette affirmation péremptoire et erronée. En fait, nous traversons des crises biologiques et écologiques (chute de la biodiversité, insécurité alimentaire, résistances aux antibiotiques, abondance de perturbateurs endocriniens, épidémies d’épidémies, etc.) qui révèlent notre incapacité à comprendre les organismes vivants.\n\nL’exemple de la biologie montre la portée politique d’un manque de réflexivité en recherche. Une objectivité collective précieuse ne peut être constituée que par une science qui théorise, examine son épistémologie, connait son histoire et les conceptions philosophiques qu’elle embarque. Alors qu’elle doit constituer le cadre qui permet l’évaluation pharmakologique[^1]de techniques émergentes, la science promet aujourd’hui des « solutions » nano/géo/bio/psycho-technologiques, automatiquement adoptées si elles voient le jour. Or, la confiance dans le processus scientifique — et donc démocratique — des citoyens s’érode quand ils s’aperçoivent que les crises actuelles proviennent des « solutions » imposées hier sans débats. Dans la fuite en avant technologique d’un capitalisme repeint en vert, la recherche — qui la permet — doit porter un regard critique sur les connaissances qu’elle élabore. Plutôt que déserter la science, la question « Doit-on continuer la recherche scientifique ? » posée par Grothendiek en 1981 doit nous inviter à pænser la science de demain — libérée de son asservissement à la croissance économique. C’est un combat politique qui nécessite une exigence créative et un tâtonnement réfléchi au quotidien. \n\nComprendre le vivant au XXIe siècle sera crucial. La biologie doit assumer ses spécificités vis-à-vis de la physique en construisant sa propre épistémologie. Sur les épaules de penseurs contemporains qui ont souligné la nécessité d’une telle révolution ontologique, le conflit d’arguments empiriques et logiques doit faire rage. La rigueur scientifique ne réside pas dans la constance de principes implicites et intemporels, mais dans l’explicitation continue de ses règles évolutives. Le changement profond dont notre société a besoin se trouve une première fois dans ce travail. D’un point de vue opérationnel, une théorie des organismes enrayera notre « maladresse » destructrice du vivant, à entendre ici dans son sens le plus inclusif. \n\nSi les dernières décennies ont déconstruit beaucoup de nos croyances culturelles et montré leurs contingences, elles ont aussi souligné leur nécessité. Cependant, nous faisons face au vide conceptuel provoqué par le démantèlement des derniers refuges permettant des activités créatives (que ce soit en science, art ou philosophie). Nos fondations s’écroulent et nous ne sommes plus en mesure d’en construire de nouvelles. Outre des replis identitaires, des indifférences pathologiques ou des folies technosolutionnistes, la douce musique d’un nouvel animisme écologique nous invite à renier notre héritage de la modernité. Pouvons-nous seulement faire fi de notre histoire ? Cette solution a-t-elle des racines empirico-logique assez profondes pour éveiller un imaginaire collectif à la hauteur de celui qui meut actuellement un capitalisme qui détruit systématiquement toute organisation biologique et sociale ? L’histoire a montré que les mathématiques et la physique, toujours en dialogue avec la philosophie et les arts, ont eu une importance majeure dans l’émergence d’époques, car elles ont façonné des visions du monde. Une théorie des organismes aura comme deuxième fonction, en insufflant des idées radicalement nouvelles, des concepts rigoureux et puissants, de participer à la reconceptualisation de nos modes d’organisation et de notre rapport au monde.

Constraints which apply to the system are not independently given (as in the Carnot engine) but rather are produced and maintained by the system itself.

(1945)         \n*The American Economic Review* 35: 519–530       \n\nReference: [Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)\n\n\n#### Hayek's contribution is identifying the mechanism of the market system\nBriefly, we sketch the essence of a market organization. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:\n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)\n\n#### Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes \nAccording to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 7) \n\nIn practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book *The Road to Serfdom* —, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.\n\n#### Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors\nHow, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 8) \n\nThe more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market _self-regulation_.\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 10) \n\n\n#### The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)\nThe decentralized plans of _self-interested actors_ — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the _competition_ for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 11) \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- Knowledge cannot be reduced to digits. This echoes the informational metaphor in biology. It tends to consider negatively (as noise) everything that cannot be digitalized, here even reduced to a single number. See [note on Longo2012](note/note%20on%20Longo2012.md).\n- It takes Whitehead remark as a goal. \n- Everyone seems independent and does not rely on others. Individuals cannot influence themselves. No mimetism. \n- The market needs an exogeous cause to change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. In practice, external events perturbing the cost of one commodity do occur all the time so that everything happen _as if_ prices were evolving because commodities were traded.","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Henriques2013":{"title":"note on Henriques2013","content":"\n## **Policy-making in science policy: The ‘OECD model’ unveiled**     \nby Henriques L., Larédo P.

First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer: \n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003eIf governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. ([OECD1966](reference/OECD1966.md) , p.8)\n\nThis input/output continuous model being *de facto* extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good. \n\nSecond, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to be on the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two countries threat each other with nuclear weapons. There is a need for being able to plan research activities. \n\nThird, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md),[Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. The market cannot anticipate what is good for societies, and as research should be funded by public funds (this is also called 'market failure'). \n\n#### The OECD led the international transformation of science\nIn this context, and based on those arguments, the OECD changed its role, which so far consisted in sharing good practices and tested policies among its members. It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S\u0026T, led by a group of experts. The model they constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). \n\n#### The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth\nThe OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needs. Some fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate ressources on specific research areas. Accordingly, quantitative indicators must be developed to assess to quality of science and refine policies: this is the birth of the Frascati manual, still in used nowadays.  \n\n#### Comments\n\n- The linear model of science is incompatible with revolutions in science ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)). \n\n- This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions. It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity.

However, they share theoretical stances, collaborate and recognize each other with topics (chaos, network, emergence, etc.).

In a nutshell, it is rather a **scientific platform.** \n\n#### Complexity sciences rely on classical ontologies and epistemologies\nStructure of scientific argumentation rely on Ockham's razor, toy modeling, **statistics**, **mathematical modeling**, and proof of concept. [backcasting](definition/backcasting.md) is also often used. Scientists usually assimilate the formal cause (not the material cause) of models to the one of reality, like in physics.\n\n\n#### Selected references\n\n[Horgan1995](reference/Horgan1995.md)\n[Israel2005](reference/Israel2005.md)\n[Deffuant2015](reference/Deffuant2015.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Longo2012":{"title":"note on Longo2012","content":"\n## **Is Information a proper observable for biological organization?**     \nby Longo G., Miquel P., Sonnenschein C., Soto A.M. (2012)   \n*Progress in biophysics and molecular biology* 109: 108-114      \nDOI: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.004\n\nReference: [Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)\n\n\n#### The central dogma of biology was formulated during the thriving era of computer programs.\nThe concepts of [computability](concept/computability.md) (hardware, software), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developed in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (and cryptography played a major role during this period), [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology that explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA.\n\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologits to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\nIt relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). This view directly eliminates the radical materiality of living organisms. For instance, Maynard Smith (that tries to explicitate the notion of information in biology without managing to distinguish Turing and Shannon'concepts) states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThere is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process (...) —  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n\n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n\n#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology\nMoreover, information is not well-defined for the living because it has ambiguous links with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](concept/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by Schrödinger ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)), it seems that organisms manage to \"resist\" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cell to cell, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (hemodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial ([Lucitti2007](reference/Lucitti2007.md), [Tang2004](reference/Tang2004.md), [Muller2003](reference/Muller2003.md), [Rot-Nikcevic2007](reference/Rot-Nikcevic2007.md), [Jakkaraju2003](reference/Jakkaraju2003.md)).  \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Mont%C3%A9vil2015":{"title":"note on Montévil2015","content":"\n#### **Biological organisation as closure of constraints**     \nby Montévil M., Mossio M.

In turn, the fundamental formal distinction between the two regimes of causation at work (constraints and processes) relies on the identification of symmetries, and local conservations, at the relevant (temporal) scales. —  ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md), p. 25) \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Montevil2021":{"title":"note on Montevil2021","content":"\n#### **Computational empiricism : the reigning épistémè of the sciences**     \nby Montevil M. (2021)         \n\n**Abstract**:  What do mainstream scientists acknowledge as original scientific contributions? In other words, what is the current épistémè in natural sciences? This essay attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical, generating data and computational, to analyze them and reproduce them with models. This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.\n\nReference: [Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)\n\n\n### Summary\n\n\n#### The IMRaD structure is about contextualizing a single unbiased observation to transform it to knowledge.\nIt is like adding a single brick on the cathedral of knowledge. The separation of results and discussion means that your mind is a virgin receptacle for information to flow inside. Then, you analyze the results that you have unbiasly seen. With the IMRaD format, scientists exchange information without being transformed (receptor, receiver). This is not theoretial thinking since the latter change how we think about phenomena. In fact, scientists do not have time to engage with specific ways to organize scientific rationality.\n\n#### Experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world, that is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from an interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon\n\nThere is a confusion between objectivity and automation. You can make something automatic with a deep unoticed theoretical commitment. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eprotocolization can also be counterproductive since it downplays the work of objectivation, that is to say, the articulation between procedures and theoretical thinking. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 5) \n\n\n#### The current épistémè still has a positivist influence\nThe scientific aim in the current épistémè is to find causal patterns or \"mechanisms\". Case studies or not considered, but they can give useful insights: the existence of one planet, the fact that something is possible, etc. The kind of knowledge that is looked for points to [scientific positivism](concept/scientific%20positivism.md). The épistémè builds on induction and is a kind of empiricism.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ecomputational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations. It cares for numerical questions (like statistics); however, it does not attend its logoi significantly, by analytical means or otherwise. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n#### Review articles contrast with original research in the current épistémè, except when statistical meta-analysis are performed\nAs review articles are typically required to be critical, the computational statistical analysis seems to considered more original then subjective critics. Review articles are requested by editors, which are often not researchers. With the massification and acceleration of scientific production, synthetic works should be valuable. They are not. However, theorization has a synthetic function.\n\n#### Modelling is specific to a phenomena, is not theoretical work and need to be included in a theoretical framework\nHowever, like in Planck's quanta case, it can be the starting point for a broader general framework. Most models are mathematical (and computational). They aim to imitate several properties with precision. Theoretical work confers a profound scientific meaning to the properties of models (Planck's quanta). Mathematical modelling is not theoretical work when it is local. When it results from a theoretical move, with original mathematical tools, it is then a part of theoritization. For instance, mathematical tools that originate from physics and transferred to biology convey implicit considerations. Models need to be included in a theoretical framework.\n\n#### Computational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations\nIt cares for numerical questions but do not attend for its logoi. Original works are empirical, generating data to analyze and reproducing them with models. In empirical works, the approach is inductive although statistical Popperian tests are usually conducted. In computational models, the ability to fit empirical data prevail on theoretical consistency or significance.\n\n\n#### The épistémè has some links with the organization of science\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eComputational empiricism is an industrialization of research activity, a paradoxical notion considering that research is about bringing new, singular insights. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis organization goes with a cumulative view of science, where productivism is a natural aim. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n#### Computational empiricism produces a state of theory disruption\nMontévil name the current épistémè _computational empiricism_. Most scientists adopt an _inductive_ approach: they generate data, analyze them and/or try to reproduce them using specific models. The analysis are predominantly statistical tests and mathematical models primarly aim at imitation. They are carried out on computers and the theoretical meaning they bear is usually not discussed. Two observations point to a _cumulative_ view of knowledge. First, the standardization of the publication structure, which contextualize a single unbiased observation to communicate an easy-to-find information to other scientists. Second, synthetic works taking place in critical and editor-ordered review articles are explicitely not considered to be original contributions unless they undertake computational meta-analysis. Finally, in the spirit of Bernard Stielger, the author diagnozed a phenomena he calls _theory disruption_, defined as follow:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn a somewhat perverse way, it also promotes empirical results that destabilize former theoretical frameworks because they catch attention. However, it does not promote rethinking these frameworks, leading to what may be called a theory disruption that is more or less advanced depending on the fields —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n### Comments\nSee also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) — Chapter Theorie and methods.

It will change it by several political reforms, led by the OECD. First, some aspects are retained or slightly modified. Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs. The linear model is modified to include \"tacit knowledge\" (another idea of Polanyi): for a good transfer of knowledge, industries and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. Despite the strong trend in public-private collaboration, more is \"strongly encouraged\".  \n\nThe major shift is that the governement should no longer plan what science should do. It should follow what \"stakeholders\" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain, public and private sector. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eCommitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) \n\nIn Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processing software and filtering out the majority by an unknown process, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the \"ivory tower\" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life. Government should be *flexible* because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficient (i.e. all the problems raised by Hayek). \n\nThe second shift is about the design of \"mission-oriented\" policies to solve grand societal challenges, top-down initiatives responding \"to the needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support\".  \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis is meant to generate increased motivation among the actors – beyond remuneration and academic recognition, the awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause is an incentive for surpassing oneself —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 32) \n\nThe rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019.

Public money, citizens. Who decides? Stakeholders, that is citizens and the private sector — the state should not interfere, only to be \"vigilant\".  This is the market of ideas. Offer and demand. Consumers are citizens and the private sector. However, the money comes citizens. The private sector does not invest whatsoever in this mechanism. They only ask which directions to pursue annd use the fruit of research. \n\nWe go back to a market system, but this is not at the scale of Polanyi. Scientists are sellers that respond to the demand of public/industrials.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n- Do citizens really decide? \n\nThe role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented.  It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal. \n\n- Can stakeholders know what is good for them ? \n\nThe market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want. However, there is no problem, \"should be monitored vigilantly by governments\".  It does not, it is incompatible [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). \n\nIn any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV? (such as the meaning of \"islamo-gauchism\"). *The scientific activity is against the doxa.* \n\n#### Idea \n\n\n\n- La confiance entre scientifiques et la population est ébranlée parce que ces derniers, sous la pression de publier, se mettent à faire jouer les \"commercial morals\" (c'est à dire, mon papier est bon car il est accepté). Dès lors, il découle une énorme crise de reproductibilité et la plupart des choses qui en sorte ne sont pas fiable.  Ils vendent des choses fragiles et font des énormes promesses. \n\n- Credit import recherche de plus en plus grand pour moins de recherche. \n\n- La tour d'ivoire est crée par le simple fait de différencier les scientifiques des citoyens. Les sccientifiques sont des citoyens et eds humains qui ont des pensées qui reflètent en partie ceux de la société. La tour d'ivoir est illusoire, elle fait comme-ci ces dderniers étaient neutres et objecctifs, près à travailler sur les sujets qu'on leur pointe du doigts. \n\n- Innovation is technological, aims at economic growth, and can only impact societies positively.

(1962)         \n*Minerva* 1: 54-73       \nDOI: 10.1007/BF01101453     \n\nReference: [Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)\n\n\n#### Background\n\nMicheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of *tacit knowledge* will be used by the OECD later. \n\nIn the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. \n\n##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. \nPolanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1].\n\nWhile Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).\n\n##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards\nHowever, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:\n\n1. Plausibility\n2. Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.\n3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists\n\n##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. \n\n##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science\nMoreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.\n- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.\n- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2]. \n\n\u003e[!warning]\n\u003e \n\u003eNeoliberalism was not the dominant ideology in the Western world at that time. The Republic of Science is more related to a liberal view of science, in the classical view, without state intervention. Sixty years later, we find an era of neoliberalism in science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)), but this has nothing to do with what is suggested here. \n\n- Idea of enablement. \n\n[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.\n[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Rovelli2017":{"title":"note on Rovelli2017","content":"\n#### **Is time’s arrow perspectival?**     \nby Rovelli C.

Bien que les politiques de la science de ces dernières décennies soient à l'origine de cette inquiétante tendance, l'organisation scientifique dont nous héritons résulte d'une superposition paradoxale de conceptions précises du rôle de la recherche scientifique. Une conséquence de cet imbroglio sont que les critiques sont dissonantes, à l'instar du débat sur l'autonomie de la science. À partir de la République de la Science de Michael Polanyi, et en essentialisant deux périodes de \"bonnes pratiques\" politique formulées par l'OCDE, nous tentons d'éclairer d'un point de vue systèmique le déclin de la théorisation en recherche. Nous l'attribuons à une perte de spécificité, d'historicité, et de générativité de la recherche scientifique. Finalement, nous montrons la pertinence d'une économie anti-entropique, définissant comme valeure pour un article scientifique l'intensité des affects de ses lecteurs, étant donné des contraintes empirico-logiques.  \n\n#### Introduction\n\nAllons-nous continuer la recherche scientifique ? C'est lors d'une conférence au CERN (Centre Européen de recherches nucléaires) en 1972 qu'Alexandre Grothendieck ouvre le débat ([Grothendieck1972](reference/Grothendieck1972.md)). Les connaissances scientifiques nous permettent de construire des technologies de plus en plus sophistiquées. Elles rendent donc possible les dégats toujours plus grands infligeables et infligés à la biosphère. Si la menace est existentielle, pourquoi ne pas arrêter l'activité qui rend leur production possible ? \n\nLa radicalité de cette question, assurément plus pertinente aujourd'hui qu'il y a un demi-siècle, a le mérite d'obliger la discussion frontale des problèmes qu'elle soulève. Elle est pourtant mal posée, car c'est la recherche scientifique qui diagnostique les dégats qu'elle engendre ([Ripple2017](reference/Ripple2017.md)) et nous ne pourrions nous poser la question s'il elle n'existait pas. \n\nLe sentiment d'impuissance que revèle cette question résulte d'un désajustement entre un système technique et les savoirs nécessaires à son appropriation individuelle et sociale, période que Bernard Stielger nomme la disruption ([Stiegler2016](reference/Stiegler2016.md)). Ce décalage prend racine dans une vision naïve de la technologie par les autorités gouvernantes ([Nolan2021](reference/Nolan2021.md)), dans laquelle elle est considérée comme intrinsèquement bonne, une solution aux problèmes, synonyme de croissance économique, et donc déterminante pour le bien-être d'une société ([Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)). \n\nL'exemple des perturbateurs endocriniens, substances chimiques qui interfèrent avec l'organisation hormonale des métabolismes, illustre ce retard presque fataliste des savoirs ([Soto2021a](reference/Soto2021a.md)). Une liste toujours grandissante de substances nocives est établie par des scientifiques. C'est seulement après plusieurs longues études et l'obtention d'un consensus scientifique qu'il est possible de constituter des arguments pouvant rivaliser avec ceux de lobbies industriels[^2] dans l'oreille d'instances politiques. Il faut donc légiférer substance après substance, mais nous savons que des combinaisons de perturbateurs endocriniens sont aussi délétaires. Le nombre d'études à conduire se multiplient alors ...  \n\nPour dépasser le diagnostique, il est nécessaire de générer des savoirs nouveaux qui changent notre approche  à ces problèmes. En science, cela s'appelle de nouvelles théories. Il semble donc que nous répondions à Grothendieck par la réponse qu'il so\n\n- Or, pour ne pas être dans le diagnostique, la détection de données, l'observation pures des catastrophes, il faut générer de nouvelles façons de voir les choses, c'est-à-dire de nouvelles théories. Il est donc crucial (non pas d'arrêter la science) que la science puisse obtenir des résultats qui la pousse vers d'autres directions. On est un pas en train de dire qu'il ne faut pas une science neutre, où scientifique devrait sortir de leur zone de confort et de sortir leur tour d'ivoir. On dit que le problème est dans la science, ce qui a le mérite d'accroître la capacité d'action.  \n\nPour réussir à faire cela il faut générer de nouveaux savoirs sur la biosphère, la technosphère, et leurs recouvrements etc. ([Montevil2021b](reference/Montevil2021b.md)). \n\n- Pour être très concret, au lieu de repousser le problème en dehors des sciences sur l'utilisation des produits qu'elle permet de faire, il faut voir comment le choix politique de l'utilisation d'un techniqiue est contraint par la théorie qui la permet. On est dans une crise sur le vivant et la prix Nobel Jennifer Doudna dit qu'elle est capable de reprogrammer le vivant. Elle tend un perche en s'appuyant sur une théorie qui peine à être dépassée en biologie. Il y a donc du très concret à opérer à l'intérieur même des sciences rapidement. ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)) Sur cet exemple, on voit le problème d'une théorie désuète qui existe toujours. \n\n- C'est un phénomène dans toutes les sciences, et plusieurs actuers s'en inquiètent. \n\n- Niveau politique : certains s'interessent vraiment au financements, à des comportements conservatifs, à des financements de grands projets plutôt que de petits [Boudreau2016](reference/Boudreau2016.md), [NuffieldCouncilonBioethics2014](reference/NuffieldCouncilonBioethics2014.md) [AmericanAcademyofArtsandSciences2008](reference/AmericanAcademyofArtsandSciences2008.md), [OECD2021](reference/OECD2021.md). À ce niveau c'est la \"recherche transformatrice\". \n\u003e \"ideas that have the potential to radically change our understanding of an important existing scientific or engineering concept or leading to the creation of a new paradigm or field of science or engineering.\" ([NationalScienceBoardU.S.2007](reference/NationalScienceBoardU.S.2007.md), p. 10)\"\n\n- Niveau scientifique : Des analyses quantitative [Chu2021](reference/Chu2021.md),[Park2023](reference/Park2023.md) pour dire que c'est un processus qui se déroule sur une longue échelle de temps, avec des indicateurs diverses.\n\u003e \"break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions\" — [Park2023](reference/Park2023.md)\n\n- Niveau science sociale : Et qualitative où l'on parle beaucoup de la pratique scientifique [Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md).  \n\u003e \"promotes empirical results that destabilize former theoretical frameworks because they catch attention. However, it does not promote rethinking these frameworks, leading to what may be called a theory disruption\"\n\n- Ce dont tout le monde parle, avec des langages différents qui vont du politique, au scientifique, jusqu'au philosophe des sciences c'est en fait tout simplement une théorie avec une empreinte de Thomas Kuhn sur la révolution scientifique, c'est à dire changement de paradigme ou tout simplement de théories. Une recherche transformatrice est une recherche théorique, qui génère de nouvelle théorie.  \n\n**Comment comprendre cette perte de la capacité à se rénouveller à la lumière des politiques de la science des dernières décennies ?** \n\n\n#### La République de la Science\n\nAvant les années soixantes, l'organisation de l'activité scientifique est considérée correctement décrite par la République de la Science de Michael Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)). C'est une oeuvre majeure dont nous ne saurions assez vivement conseiller la lecture aujourd'hui. Frère de Karl Polanyi, membre de la société du Mont-Pélerin et grand ami de Friedrich Hayek, ce physico-chimiste devenu philosophe des sciences et économiste est un personnage atypique (image photo). S'insipirant explicitement de la main invisible d'Adam Smith, il décrit une societé d'exploreurs non mécaniciste qu'il distingue explicitement d'un modèle de marché ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)). Nous exposons ici le stricte nécéssaire à la schématisation systèmique de son modèle que nous travaillerons dans la suite (Fig. 1). \n\nPolanyi décrit cette société de chercheurs commes des initiatives indépendantes en ajustement mutuelles. Chacun des membres, en tant qu'acteur économique rationel, maximise sa réputation qui s'obtient en produisant des contributions qui s'évaluent gâce aux *critères de mérite*. Ces critères suivent deux logiques complémentaires et antagonistes : celle du conformisme (plausabilité, précision, interêt scientifque du sujet) et celle de l'originalité (degré de surprise du résultat).   \n\nL'évaluation de ces critères de mérite est assurée par des scientifiques qui partagent des zones d'expertise (*overlapping neighborhood*s). Si l'ensemble de ces zones se recouvrent une à une, chaque membre peut se porter garant de l'ensemble de l'opinion scientifique (*scientific opinion*). Néanmoins, les critère de mérites étant génériques, l'*authorité scientifique* est assurée dans une zone spécifique de la science après un processus *d'interprétation contextuelle* des critères de mérites que *tout* scientifique doit donc effectué : qu'est-ce qui est original et conforme dans mon domaine d'étude ? La constitution de cette autorité est d'abord nécéssaire pour le collectif car elle détermine les résultats d'examens par les pairs mais aussi les allocations des ressources matérielles et la sélection de projets finaancés. Cependant, elle est aussi importante individuellement car cette synthèse critique permet à la chercheuse de proposer un projet très original pour accroître son mérite. \n\nCette société d'exploreurs — qui se dirige vers une direction inconnue  — repose sur un orthodoxie dynamique qui encourage sa propre subversion. Les critères de mérites dialogiques permettent l'amélioration des connaissances car chaque scientifique intègre les résultats de ses collègues pour choisir son prochain sujet de recherche. Or, puisque l'opinion scientifique évolue, elle change le contexte déterminant l'interprétation des critères de mérite, c'est-à-dire l'authorité scientifique. Cette authorité détermine à son tour les projets sélectionnés et les contributions adoubées. Cette circularité rend l'activité scientifique *traditionelle*, c'est-à-dire spécifique et historique. L'état actuel des connaissances résulte d'une ineffable succession de synthèse critiques permettant des choix individuels qui ne peuvent être compris qu'en retraçant l'histoire des contributions et des transmissions locales de savoirs, de générations en générations. Finalement, l'existence de l'authorité traditionelle et dynamique dépend donc de l'originalité de ses membres. (Fig. 1)\n\n\n#### Les années 60 et l'idéologie technicienne.\n\nLa publication de Polanyi est comptemporaine à l'apparition d'un intérêt politique pour la science. Cette transformation peut être analysée à travers \"les bonnes pratiques\" politiques partagées par l'OCDE (l'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques) qui a été et demeure très influente en terme de politique coordonnée d'une science occidentale mondialisée. Néanmoins, ces politiques interviennent sans aucun modèle explicite d'organisation pouvant se substituer à celui de Polanyi ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). Elles ont modifiées et augmentées le modèle existant. Nous essayerons d'essentialiser les réformes effectuées en terme d'une variation minimale au modèle présenté ci-dessus, après y avoir résumé l'idéologie motrice. \n\nDurant cette période, il est remarqué que les changements structurels de l'économie qui assurent une rapide croissance économique sont médiés par des innovations technologiques. Un modèle linéaire d'innovation (recherche fondamentale, recherche appliquée, puis développement et diffusion de technologies) indique qu'il faut financer ainsi la recherche fondamentale pour assurer la croissance. Puisqu'il est sous-entendu que la croissance économique est bénéfique à la société, la science devenant un bien public. On ne peut plus la laisser aux mains de scientifiques et il faut centraliser son organisation au niveau de l'État qui doit poser des priorités en matière de recherche. Le projet Manattan démontre l'efficacité que peut avoir des missions ordonnées directement par le gouvernement. D'ailleurs, dans un contexte de guerre froide, aller sur la lune ou construire une bombe atomique ne peut plus être qu'une simple question de curiosité ([Godin2020](reference/Godin2020.md)). \n\nApprécions la contradiction qui réside dans l'ajout d'une plannification centrale dans une organisation implicite basée sur un modèle libéral. Selon Polanyi, une autorité centrale conduirait à une science \"à l'arrêt\". Comment cette autorité centrale intervient-elle dans le modèle de Polanyi ? Nous considérerons, comme d'autres avant nous ([Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md), [Scott2007](reference/Scott2007.md)), qu'elle *ajoute* un critère de mérite non-épistémique (la pertinence societale du sujet de recherche) et qu'elle en choisit le contenu. L'idéologie d'une science au service de la croissance économique grâce à l'innovation technologique est toujours dominante aujourd'hui ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). \n\n#### L'Ère néolibérale et le retour de la main invisible. \n\nLe tournant néolibérale à l'entrée du XXIeme siècle ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md), [Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md)) se caractérise par l'introduction d'une compétition artificielle entre chercheurs, par exemple avec les indices bibliométriques qui génèrant les effets délétaires de la \"loi de Goodhart\" ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)). Un discours politique ultralibérale souhaite des réformes \"inégalitaire\" et des sélections naturelles \"darwinienne\" entre chercheurs ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)). Des pratiques managariales veulent stimuler les scientifiques pour qu'ils se surpassent ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)), les faire participer à des projets grand et nobles — dans le cadre idéologique donné — pour qu'ils puissent se sentir \"fier d'être européen\" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/)). L'on parle de \"taskforce\" ou \"workforce\" scientifique pour désigner des individus génériques et interchangeables. Les frontières du modèle linéaire d'innovation s'effacent pour un rapprochement grandissant entre recherche privée et publique ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). Cette tendance fait écho à la corrélation négative entre l'activité de recherche privé et de leur participation grandissante dans le processus d'orientation de la recherche public ([Arora2018](reference/Arora2018.md)). À défaut d'amener de la recherche fondamentale dans les start-ups ([Maxmen2019](reference/Maxmen2019.md)), ces dernières ont introduit les \"morales commerciales\" ([Hayek1979](reference/Hayek1979.md)[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) dans la recherche : une étude qu'il faut \"vendre\" est bonne *parce qu*'elle est acceptée dans un bon journal. L'élaboration de projets scientfiques qui sont soumis à selection s'apparente à un rite de promesses parfois délirantes ([Audetat2015](reference/Audetat2015.md)) et certains phénomène évoquent des systèmes de Ponzi ([Mirowski2012](reference/Mirowski2012.md)). Bien que les universités se révoltent unanimement et qu'associations de chercheurs et autre organisations accumulent des preuves montrant le caractère délétaire des politiques dont ils sont victimes ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Sandstrom2018](reference/Sandstrom2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)), le manque de reproductivité et les fraudes explosent ([Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md),[Fang2012](reference/Fang2012.md), [Edwards2017](reference/Edwards2017.md)) dans certaines disciplines.\n\nCette deuxième époque de politique de la science est elle aussi en contradiction avec le modèle de Polanyi. Le modèle néolibérale a décidé de décentraliser la planification des priorités de recherche, mais dans l'idée d'instaurer un marché de projets scientifiques entre chercheurs et \"stakeholders\" (industriels et citoyens). L'État joue le rôle des mécanismes porteurs de signaux et d'instructions, qui oriente les fonds publiques vers les recherches qui répondent à la demande ([Demeritt2000](reference/Demeritt2000.md),[McNie2007](reference/McNie2007.md),[Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). Le vocabulaire introduit par Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) est repris de sorte que l'État doit être \"flexible\" pour \"s'adapter rapidement\" au changement. Il doit aussi s'assurer \"d'envoyer des bons signaux aux 'stakeholders' \" en introduisant des projets \"top-down\", c'est-à-dire des \"missions\" orientés vers un besoin urgent de la société. Au regard des remarques précédentes, il est légitime de questionner le poids relatifs des citoyens dans les décisions quant aux priorités que la science doit adoptée. Néanmoins, quand les citoyens participent, comme dans cet exemple aux Pays-Bas, ils posent leurs questions (12 000 en tout) en lien avec la science, sur internet. Elles sont regroupées automatiquement par un logiciel de traitement de mot pour en garder 2% qui deviendront 1% après des conférences organisés entre les participants. Elle sont ensuites considérées comme des priorités scientifiques ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). \n\nRetenons ici pour notre modèle que le contenu du critère de mérite non-épistémique n'est plus laissé à l'appréciation du chercheur. Il doit maintenant s'efforcer, dans l'exercice de son autorité, d'assurer l'équilibre entre la demande (civile, industrielle) qu'on lui communique, et l'offre, c'est-à-dire les projets qui lui sont proposés et qu'il sélectionnent (Fig. 1, en rouge).\n\n#### Le Marché des Technosciences\n\n0) Sur la question de l'autonomie de la science\n\nNous venons de voir que la politique de la science a instrumentalisé la recherche puis a instauré un marché de projets scientifiques. Qu'elle soit un instrument, une machine, un outils ou une système qui tend vers l'équilibre, la dynamique de cette organisation ne peut s'expliquer, pour des raisons épistémologiques, qu'en faisant appel à une cause extérieure. Or, la canalisation des fonds alloués à la recherche est toujours effectuée par des scientifiques qui sélectionnent les projets qui se réaliseront. Dès lors, comment expliquer l'intériorisation \"de bonnes pratiques\" dans la République de la Science ? Ce problème complexe se résume souvent à la question de \"l'autonomie de la science\" et n'est pas nouveau ([Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md),[Scott2007](reference/Scott2007.md)). Il permet d'aborder des aspects idéologiques ([Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md), [Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) ou sociologiques ([Laillier2022](reference/Laillier2022.md)) à l'intérieur des sciences. Cependant, nous pensons le concept d'autonomie (auto, *nomos*, se donner ses propres lois) est vague pour une organisation sociale qui n'inclue pas toute la société ([Castoriadis1975](reference/Castoriadis1975.md)). Cela peut aussi les dissonnances des critiques formulées envers la gouvernance de la société des exploreurs ([Giry2022](reference/Giry2022.md)). Bien que notre étude puisse être lié à cette problèmatique, nous nous proposons d'expliquer le déclin d'une activité spécifique, la théorisation, d'un point de vue systémique. Nous en concluerons une perte de spécificité, d'historicité et de générativité du savoirs et des savoir-faire scientifiques. Nous procédons en deux étapes, d'abord en introduisant le critère de mérite non-épistémique (Fig. 1) discuté plus haut, ensuite en considérant l'automatisation des directions de recherche empruntés par les chercheurs. \n\n1) Spécificité\n\nNous avons établit que la dialogique des critères de mérite (conformisme/originalité) oblige la constitution d'une autorité scientifique qui est bénéfique pour le collectif mais aussi pour le chercheur en question (car il sera plus à même de s'atteler à sujet original). Il peut arriver que les projets proposés par plusieurs chercheurs soit similaires. L'histoire des sciences regorge de ces courses à la priorité pour une même découverte ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)) et cette remarque sociologique demeure aujourd'hui un facteur caractérisant les chercheurs dans les modèles économiques de la science ([Stephan2015](reference/Stephan2015.md)). En fait, cet aspect à l'avantage d'attirer notre attention sur l'absolu nécessité de \"sauvegarder la pluralité conflictuelle à base d'argument empirico-logique\" qui est la règle du jeu de la science ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md)). Le savoir scientifique est fonctionel à l'exterieur des sciences à condition qu'il ai fait consensus, c'est-à-dire que les conflits qui *doivent* avoir exister, disparaissent[^1] . Néanmoins, l'introduction d'un troisième critère de mérite vient dissiper cette conflictualité bénéfique pour tous. À un antagonisme (*anta*, face-à-face, *agôn*, lutte) poussant chaque acteur à trouver les arguments scientifiques pour combattre ses adversaires, se substitue une concurrence (*concourir*, course vers un même point) entre rivaux qui ont un objectif commun, non-épistémique. La nature de la compétition se transformant, les acteurs ont la liberté de ne pas se trouver d'adversaire. Ils partionnent l'espace infini des projets ratachables aux thèmes jugés prioritaires par l'autorité politique. Les chercheurs évitent ainsi les sujets originaux quand ils font encore le nécessaire pour les identifier (voir plus bas). La compétition artificielle instaurée par les politiques néolibérale catalysent certainement ce phénomène d'étalement et d'ocupation de l'espace.\n\nAvant cette disruption partielle, l'état des savoirs à un moment donné était spécifique car il était le résultat d'une histoire disciplinaire, unique et invariante. En pratique, on justifiait un projet en faisant référence au passé, à une tradition et à des successions de d'interogations épistémiques qui ont trouvé réponses plus ou moins satisfesantes. Après cette disruption, l'on motive un projet essentiellement en faisant référence aux futurs possibles. Un nombre inéffables de projets pouvent donc être acceptés dans des zones toujours plus générique de l'espace infini des connaissances. La \"workforce\" scientifique a intérêt — au sens économique du terme — à travailler de manière productiviste sur un projet où, seul, il ne se verra pas freiner par une remise en question de son autorité. En pratique, l'on trouvera alors un article scientifique sur tous les sujets possibles et imaginables. \n\n2) Historicité\n\nAvant cette disruption, pour expliquer l'opinion scientifique actuelle sur un certain sujet, il fallait parler de trajectoires académiques croisées, mutuellement dépendantes. Si le savoir devient générique et contribue à dissimuler son historicité, l'introduction des mécanisme de marché prolonge et termine cette transformation. En effet, l'épistémologie de la physique utilisée pour dérire une organisation de marché ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) est anhistorique ([Koppl2015](reference/Koppl2015.md)). Une loi d'équilibre global entre offre et demande peut être inférée d'une somme d'optimisations locales : la dynamique des chercheurs est gouvernée par des signaux (les projets ou \"missions\" financés) qui servent d'instructions pour des acteurs rationels. En adoptant une démarche nécéssairement inductive, des problèmes *préexistants* sont étudiés avec des théories considérés intemporellement valides. \n\nCes théories, qui montrent leurs limites quand elles sont mises à l'épreuve d'un empirisme computationel, ne sont pas renouvellées car le marché ne prone pas une activité théorique. Il en résulte une activitée extractiviste d'informations où les instruments de production et d'analyse de données font oublier que leur potentialité d'objectivé ne réside que dans le rationel extrêmement spécifique qui choisit de les mesurer ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). Nous assistons donc à l'étude de sujets de plus en plus génériques à travers des théories spécifiques et qui ne changent pas. L'absence de leur variation renforce la croyance en leur caractère intemporelle. Par ailleurs, raconter l'histoire des sciences, c'est raconter l'histoire des théories scientifiques car c'est les variations de l'entendement collectif qui *font date*. S'il n'y a plus rien à raconter ou à enseigner, les théories se rigidifient.\n\n3) Générativité\n\nLe travail théorique demande nécessairement d'adopter un point de vue plus large qu'une la théorie unique et ceci selon deux perspectives : historique et disciplinaire. D'abord, l'histoire d'une tradition scientifique n'est rarement que \"le musée des erreurs de la raison\" où \"l'antériorité chronologique est une infériorité logique\" ([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md), p. 54). Les épaules des géants sur lesquelles nous nous tenons supportent aussi le poids d'interrogations fondamentales qui traversent les époques. Il y a donc des chemins que leurs raisonnements défrichent et qui nous permettent de cartographier le territoire pour emprunter des voies réellement nouvelles. Ensuite, bien qu'il soit banal d'affirmer qu'il faut détenir l'expertise d'une théorie pour prétendre à la renouveller, il est plus rare de considérer que connaître inclu comparer, situer, distinguer. En d'autre termes, connaître une théorie signifie pouvoir énumérer ses spécificités *par rapport* à d'autres. Par exemple, on réalise véritablement que l'hydrodynamique adopte une description continue de la matière seulement lorsqu'on la contraste avec une description de mécanique liquides moléculaires. Selon ces deux perspectives, c'est l'irréductible débordement par-delà de la sur-spécialisation sous-disciplinaire qui permet le travail théorique. Il demande une synthèse critique de savoirs suffisament diversifiés et une réflexivité épistémologique quant à la spécificité de ses méthodes. \n\nSi les mécanismes du marché définissent les contenus devant être mis en avant par l'arbitrage de l'autorité scientifique, alors les efforts à fournir pour la constitution de cette dernière sur la base des critères de mérite dialogiques ne sont plus nécéssaires. Dès lors, la synthèse critique de la litérature que doit réaliser un chercheur n'est plus obligatoire et il n'a pas intérêt — au sens économique du terme — à s'atteler à cette tâche fastidieuse (processus 3 en Fig.1) . Cette prolètarisation, c'est-à-dire cet assujetissement à un système mécanique auquels les tâches jadis accomplies ont été déléguées, est d'autant plus délétaire que les scientifiques sont leur propres contrôleurs. \n\nNotons qu'il n'est pas strictement nécéssaire qu'un marché existe pour que ce phénomène se produise. Mais une autorité politique ferme imposant des directions de recherche devrait fournir un rationel critiquable et procèderait donc une forme d'objectivité qui ferait date dans ses évolutions. Ici le mécanisme de marché, dans une confusion malheureuse entre automatisation et objectivité, pulvérise totalement la notion de responsabilité : personne ne peut dire pourquoi il recherche ce qu'il recherche autrement que par l'injonction doctrinal de l'offre rencontrant la demande. Le manque de considération pour les articles critiques de synthèse (\"review articlce\") reflète cette confusion délétaire à l'intérieur même de la science. Il ne sont aujourd'hui qualifié de travaux originaux que s'il réalisent une méta-analyse computationelle ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). \n\nLa science est ce que les scientifiques pensent et l'on peut s'alarmer de la trivialisation de leurs savoirs par l'automatisaton et la privation de leur savoir-faires ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)). La perte de générativité des articles scientifique ([Park2023](reference/Park2023.md)) étant évidemnent synonyme de celle des scientifiques, il faut aussi s'interroger sur le caractère anthropologique d'un manque de créativité au-delà du déclin du travail de synthèse critique. La massification des articles au format standardisé privilégie la quantité d'information à la qualité interprétative des opinions. Outre l'effet de nombre noyant les recherches les plus originales ([Chu2021](reference/Chu2021.md)), la pratique théorique préfère sûrement quelques opinions bien formulées, situées et positionnées qu'un déluge d'informations dissumulant souvent la charge théorique qui les hante ou les philosophies qui motive leur présentation. \n\n4) Anti-entropie\n\nNous retrouvons ici dans les formes de communication entre chercheurs l'effacement de la pluralité conflictuelle mentionné plus haut, celle qui commence par la polarisation du chercheur à la lecture d'articles qui engagent la réflexion. Ainsi, il y a comme un gaspillage gigantesque de protensions intellectuelles. Une science générative devrait capitaliser sur les affects de ses chercheurs car ils sont les témoins de l'originalité d'une recherche. Plus que le simple de degré de surprise, et l'histoire des sciences nous le confirme, l'originalité se traduit surtout pour les lecteurs par des admirations, mépris, incompréhensions, déni, etc. C'est donc une vision spinoziste de la valeure qu'il serait collectivement verteux de cultiver : \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e\"Nous ne nous efforçons pas vers quelque objet, nous ne le voulons, ne le poursuivons, ni ne le désirons pas parce que nous jugeons qu’il est un bien, mais au contraire nous ne jugeons qu’un objet est un bien que parce que nous nous efforçons vers lui parce que nous le voulons, le poursuivons et le désirons.\" (Spinoza, Éthiques III/9)\n\nLe désir n'est plus celui d'être publié dans des journaux qui transmettent leur valeure aux articles qu'ils contiennent, mais la valeure d'un article est fonction des affects de ses lecteurs une fois que les critères empirico-logiques sont contrôlés. Cette valeure est d'autant plus pertinente qu'elle décroit généralement dans le temps, au fil de la diffusion du savoir qui ne surprendra plus. Elle a aussi un fort potentiel génératif qui se partage en se diversifiant et en se démultipliant par contaminations successives. Cette transmission ne subit aucunement un loi unilatérale de dégradation, comme l'est une valeure basée sur la quantité d'information. En effet, dans la structure formatée des articles, il est considéré que l'auteur détient le maximum d'information qu'il essaie de transmettre (dans le sens de Shannon) en minimisant le coût de transmission et la dégradation par le bruit c'est-à-dire les mots inutiles, les effets de styles, les adverbes, phrases longues. Si quelques explications sont répétées, c'est que la redondance peut être salvatrice pour un canal de transmission ou un récepteur non-idéaux. Néanmoins, il est impossible que le lecteur soit plus riche que l'auteur, ce qui n'est pas cohérent avec le simple fait que, de la lecture contextualisée d'une opinion peut jaillir une idée révolutionnaire qui aura plus de valeure encore. Polanyi et après lui les modèles économiques de la sciences considère l'originalité des chercheurs comme un facteur intrinsèque discréminants. Une économie des passions, dépassant celles de l'orgueil (réputation) et de la cupidité dans un modèle de marché, serait le début d'un modèle d'organisation anti-entropique ([Alombert2021](reference/Alombert2021.md)) dans la République des Savoirs. \n\n###### Conclusion\n\nPlus que jamais peut-être, la science devrait générer de nouvelles théories, c'est-à-dire imaginer de nouvelles conceptions du monde qui satisfasse des critères empiriques et logiques. Cependant, politiques, scientifiques et philosophes s'accordent pour constater que la pratique théorique se marginalise en science naturelles ([OECD2021](reference/OECD2021.md),[Park2023](reference/Park2023.md),[Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)), notamment en biologie ([Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md), [Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)). Nous avons fait dialoguer ce constat avec une esquisse des politiques des sciences occidentale depuis plus d'un demi-siècle que nous avons essentialiser à deux périodes. Dans les années soixantes, une instrumentalisation des sciences afin de servir la croissance écoonomique et les besoins de la société ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). Au tournant du XXIeme siècle, l'instauration d'un marché où la demande (du secteur privé et des citoyens) est transformée en appel d'offre pour les chercheurs via l'instauration de projets sélectivement financés par l'État ([Demeritt2000](reference/Demeritt2000.md), [Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). \n\nLa noeud gordien réside dans la contradiction entre une science qui peut toujours être considérée comme \"autonome\" ([Giry2022](reference/Giry2022.md)) — car les projets et les articles sont évalués majoritairement par des scientifiques — et la mécanisation d'une organisation qui doit faire d'avantage recourt à une forme d'externalité pour expliquer sa dynamique (respectivement l'instrument ou l'équilibre du marché). Notre étude s'intéresse donc à comprendre un processus d'intériorisation, en République des Sciences, d'éléments menant au diagnostique mentionné ci-dessus. Elle se propose d'enrichir des explications idéologiques ([Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) et sociologiques ([Laillier2022](reference/Laillier2022.md)). \n\n%%%%%%%%%%%% RACCOURCIR en 1 PARAPH ? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nEn découvrant le travail de Michael Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)), nous avons souligner la double fonction d'un *interprétation* contextualisée des critères de mérite dialogiques (conformité/originalité) résulant d'une synthèse critique de l'opinion scientifique à un moment donné. Elle permet premièrement à une chercheuse de sélectioner les projets (financements) et les contributions (*peer-review*) de ses pairs. Mais cette authorité est aussi génératrice de diversité car elle constitue les ressources intelectuelles nécéssaires à cette même chercheuse pour faire un choix, concernant son propre sujet de recherche, qu'elle juge \"le plus original possible\" — dans son rôle d'actrice économique rationelle. \n\nL'introduction d'un critère de mérite non-épistémique (pertinence vis-à-vis des besoins de la société) a libéré une pression de pluralité conflictuelle sur des sujets qui pouvaient être considérés originaux par plusieurs acteurs à la fois. À cet antagonisme, s'est substitué la concurrence de production de savoirs d'un type spécifique (technicisé, opératoire) dans un domaine de connaissances infini. Les chercheurs ont alors interêt de partitioner cet espace pour répondre à des besoins externes de manière productiviste, tout en évitant le conflit ou s'assurant la priorité de découverte ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). Ainsi, le savoir devient en contenu de plus en plus générique — et l'on peut trouver une étude sur n'importe quel sujet —, tout en reposant sur des démarches ou des théories très spécifiques. Renouveller ces théories exige que chacun se constitue une autorité scientifique, mais ceci n'est plus *nécéssaire* dans cette nouvelle organisation. \n\nCette tendance est catalysée par la compétition atificielle introduites par les réformes néolibérales et s'automatise par l'instauration d'un mécanisme de marché. **L'historicité de l'organisation décrite par M. Polanyi, où l'originalité des scientifiques *faisait date* en actant des changements quasi-unanime de théories, disparait ([Park2023](reference/Park2023.md)).** Des scientifiques habillés de théories intemporelles répondent au besoins du marché et la méthode inductive devient naturellement la norme. Or, la pratique théorique étant systémiquement dépréciée, les théories montrent leurs limites et ne sont pas renouvellées ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). Les instruments de production et d'analyse de données font oublier que leur potentialité d'objectivé ne réside que dans le rationel extrêmement spécifique qui choisit de les mesurer, c'est-à-dire la théorie sous-jacente. La massification d'informations dépourvues de sens théorique rend la possibilité de renouvellement de plus en plus difficile à cause d'un effet d'abondance délétaire ([Chu2021](reference/Chu2021.md)). \n\n%%%%%%%%%%%% RACCOURCIR en 1 PARAPH ? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n-  Perte de sens dans le système, nouveaux imaginaires, nouvelles propositions et philosophies ([Pieiller2023](reference/Pieiller2023.md)).

C'est plus facile de contraindre ce que tu connais. \n\n\n\nUn enjeu majeur de l'Anthropocène sera de repenser une nouvelle science qui renoue avec quelques unes de ses caractéristiques passés: pas d'asservissement à la croissance économique et la fabrication de technologies, ni aux besoins des citoyens. La recherche doit être considérée comme un pari assurément gagnant au long terme, mais dont les résultats sont radicalement impréscriptibles. Comme d'autres activités créatrices, elle nourrit nos imaginaires, s'en alimente en retour, et ne peut se résumer à son aspect utilitariste.

The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a \"commited\" and \"flexible\" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions \"stakeholders\" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research. \n\n\n\nTO READ FOR MISSION-ORIENTED. \n[Directorate-GeneralforResearchandInnovationEuropeanCommission2018](reference/Directorate-GeneralforResearchandInnovationEuropeanCommission2018.md)\n\n\n#### New Principles\n\nCreativité et affects.

Value is affect.\n\n###\n\nThis is the most fatalist aspect, because it points to the fact that each problem is automatically solved by the same solution. This solution is to resort to technological apparatus, which need to be designed by science. If scientists do rely on mechnaized protocoles, we would enter a new world where mechanized apparatus would have a very special status. In some way, this excludes the fade idea that they will dominate the World by rebelling and fighting humans. Instead, machines would have managed to autonomized their continued existence. By contaminating so deeply the noesis of human brains, they would have made them automatically resort to the same solution for solving the problems they had generated: do more of them. There is, in fact, a potential motor in the dialogical aspect of techologies — their pharmakon nature. Therefore, by using humans so deeply convinced that technologies are solutions — solely have a positive aspect — they would have find a way to autonomize their existence. \n\nAssuming that technologies can have a non beneficial aspect for humans (put a man out of work cannot be only and all the time positive, climate change, etc.). It suffice for machines to be in the hands of humans that think of them as solutions to conquer the World. \n\nMaking human societies automatically respond to their problem by machines is a way for them to self-renew and prosper. It does not matter if new scientific protocoles are constructed and adopted as long as they are protocoles, mechanized operations to construct technological apparatus. It is the automaticity of our response (building machines) in approaching problems that makes machines self-renew and exist.\n\nLet's take the point of view of machines. What would have them managed to do? They would have parasited human societies and use them to survive and prolifer. Let's understand them as a noetic specie. The idea of mechanism. Human would have generated dystopias, where they have human shapes and conquer the worldwith weapons that became out of control. With this picture humans could have externalize the threat and neglect that it was their own choice.\n\nWhat is a functionning part of societies? It is the part that make the machinary function. When saying that artists and philosopher do not contribute, it is understood that they do not contribute in making machines exists and sustain themselves. Even small salary jobs  are depreciated because they do not participate in making more machinesand automatic responses. Building strategies, protocoles, methods, algorithms, technological apparatus, drugs, etc. Those are the jobs that pay. If you do not work for machines, you are not welcome in this society. \n\nIf we allow us to give some kind of substance for the \"mecanicist\" idea (with an extended definition) and call the idea Julia, then we will understand everything that we do is for Julia to self-renew, proliferate and prosper. We do this without thinking about it, such as cells in our bodies. Julia is always renewed and we replace each of its apparatus with a new one when damaged (such as cells in our bodies), we invent new things that has new functions for Julia. Julia generates our problems, but we automatically solve them by maintaining or replacing or  renewing Julia. Working for Julia is not a question and it done automatically, such as the proteins that  make a very impossible trajectory  but that do it still. Not working for Julia is depreciated in our society. Doing work for humans is not well seen: heal them, clean their place, taking care of them when their are useless (babies or old), feed them without Julia's standards. However, if you contribute in making Julia, you are weel accepted: algorithms (the best), making protocoles,  making machines, methodologies, detail steps.

La radicalité de la question a le mérite d'obliger la discussion frontale des problèmes qu'elle soulève. Les connaissances scientifiques nous permettent de construire des objets techniques de plus en plus sophistiqués. Ces machines, outils, technologies ou autre entités mécaniques rendent possible la destruction, ou plus justement, la désorganisation de la biosphère.  Puisqu'ils sont une condition nécéssaire à l'ampleur des dégats causés pourquoi ne pas arrêter l'activité qui rend leur production possible ? \n\nAvant de reformuler les termes du débat et d'y répondre, l'éléphant dans la pièce. Il ne fait aucun doute que l'efficacité et la vitesse d'un tel processus auto-destructeur ne puisse s'expliquer sans le modèle économique capitaliste dans lequel il se déroule. Pour comprendre notre entrée dans l'Anthropocène, il me parait plus judicieux de travailler son rôle causal: le capitalisme est-il un catalyseur puissant de cette transformation ? Autrement dit, dans un autre système économique, n'aurions-nous pas eu les mêmes problèmes quelques dizaines ou centaines d'années plus tard ? Bien que cette question ne soit pas traitée ici, des éléments de réponses me semble apparaître en répondant à la première. \n\nLa question du mathématicien ne peut s'avérer plus actuelle. Alors que Grothendieck ne peut s'inquièter principalement \"que\" de la bombe nucléaire en cette année 1972 qui verra la publication du rapport Meadows, les problèmes existentiels ou délétaires auquels nous faisons face et dont nous avons connaissance sont bien plus nombreux aujourd'hui: chute de la biodiversité, fragilisation de l'agriculture en surexploitant, dissémination de perturbateurs endocriniens, épidémies d'épidemies, crises d'antibiotiques, réchauffement climatique, etc. Or, ces problèmes caractérisant l'Anthropocène (restraint à ces aspects strictement biologiques ici) sont tous provoqués \"grâce\" (double guillemets) à des technologies: OGM, pesticides, médicaments de synthèse, machines extractivistes ou de construction, etc.\n\nCe point, bien qu'indéniable, ne peut se faire réellement entendre par des autorités gouvernantes pour qui la techologie ne peut avoir qu'un impact positif ([Nolan2021](reference/Nolan2021.md),[Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)). Depuis les années soixantes[^1] ([OECD1966](reference/OECD1966.md)), seuls les aspects bénéfiques (pour la croissance économique) des technologies est considérée ([Godin2020](reference/Godin2020.md)). Dès lors, la question qui nous interesse ne peut pas être posée car la technique est la solution aux problèmes. Admettre que la technique peut nuire au-delà de quelques erreures mineures, revient à remettre en question la corrélation entre croissance économique et bien-être des sociétés. Il semble impossible de maximiser la croissance économique par la production massives de technologies disruptive sans impact délétaires sur la société. En retour, ce déni donne lieu à des solutions technologiques proposées peu convaincantes ([Tordjman2021a](reference/Tordjman2021a.md)), pouvant même aggraver les maux dans leur versions technoprophétiques. \n\nNéanmoins, on ne peut imiter ceux qui, s'empressant de jetter l'eau du bain les yeux fermés, n'ont pas l'hygiène de se souvenir du plus important et comettent l'erreur la plus grave. Il suffit de relever que la science interpelle aussi sur les dégats qu'elle permet de causer. Elle alimente les débats démocratiques et constitue, par définition, le savoir le plus largement partageable et joue le rôle d'un ciment pour notre culture et nos connaissances. Dès lors, en adoptant ce dernier point de vue, la question \"Allons-nous continuer la recherche scientifique ?\" résonne d'une nouvelle manière aujourd'hui. Nous assistons à des désertions, des dépressions, des burn-outs, des pertes de sens, attèrements, démissions du milieu scientifique, des conseils politiques. L'enjeu est renversé: a-t-on les moyens humains, la volonté ou la possibilité de continuer cette activité ? \n\n#### Une recherche scientifique malmenée et technicisée \n\nIl faut dire que la situation est grave. La chercheuse, à qui il revient donc, par élimination succesive des maillons de la chaine menant à l'innovation technologique salvatrice, de sauver la planète, se retrouve dans deux cas de figure. Soit elle doit accumuler de nouvelles données pour diagnostiquer encore un peu mieux l'état avancé du processus en cours et ses effets devastateurs pour la biosphère dont son ensemble. Ainsi, elle portera ses résultats à des conseils politique qui n'auront une capacité négligeable d'action et s'en agacera. Soit, elle essayera de convaincre ses collègues et soi-même que la bio/nano/geo-technologie sur laquelle elle travaille pourra effectivement avoir un réel effet paliatif sur ces crises. \n\nElle devra participer au rites des promesses délirantes ([Audetat2015](reference/Audetat2015.md)) pour espérer avoir la possibilité d'accomplir ce qu'elle sait intimement impossible. Or il est aisé de trouver le source de ces amplifications de résultat scientifiques (à venir ou non) qui se trouve dans la fusion progressive de la recherche fondamentale public et des instances applicatives ou commerciale. À défaut d'amener de la science dans les start-ups ([Maxmen2019](reference/Maxmen2019.md)), ces dernières ont partager le concept de système de ponzi ([Mirowski2012](reference/Mirowski2012.md)) et les \"morales commerciales\" ([Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) dans la recherche: une étude est bonne *parce qu'elle* est acceptée dans un bon journal. Cette transformation témoigne du tournant néolibérale que le monde académique a emprunté depuis un quart de siècle ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md), [Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md)) et qui se confronte maintenant aux effets pervers de la \"loi de Goodhart\" ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)). La reproductivité et les fraudes explosent ([Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md),[Fang2012](reference/Fang2012.md), [Edwards2017](reference/Edwards2017.md)), mais les modèles économiques montrent que c'est en intensifiant le pression \"publier ou périr\" qu'ils diminueront ([Lacetera2011](reference/Lacetera2011.md)), alors le PDG scientiste du CNRS peut se permettre de souhaiter une compétition \"darwinienne\" entre chercheurs ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)). Les scientifiques deviennent une \"scientific workforce\" interchangeable qu'il faut \"manager\" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/), [Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). Tout ceci se passant dans la révolte unanime des universités, associations de chercheurs et autre organisations qui prennent de leurs temps pour accumuler des preuves montrant le caractère infondé des politiques dont ils sont victimes ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Sandstrom2018](reference/Sandstrom2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)). \n\nRemontons un peu plus loin pour comprendre d'où vient ce malaise. Dans les années soixantes, la corrélation entre production technologiques, croissance économique et bien-être de la société occidentale était positive. Le lien de causalité a été déclarée, la science considérée comme bien public et trop importante pour être laissée seulement aux scientifiques. L'OCDE outrepasse sur son rôle de conseillers politique et commence à prendre la baguette sans jamais expliciter son modèle théorique ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)): il faut centraliser la science et le gouvernement doit poser des priorités en matière de recherche. La recherche est financée par de l'argent publique car les investissements privés ne sauraient être optimaux ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md), [Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)). Dans ce contexte de guerre froide, aller sur la lune ou construire une bombe atomique ne peut plus être qu'une question de curiosité. Il faut être de plus en plus compétitif, c'est-à-dire rapide et innovant. Science et technologies ne font plus qu'un pôle de politique publique qui marginalisera la recherche de ces discussions au profit de l'innovation ([Godin2019](reference/Godin2019.md)). \n\nComment comprendre les effets sur la science de la prise en main de l'appareil étatique par l'idéologie néolibéral, doctrine dont tout processus de centralisation et de planification lui est insuportable ? On est d'abord forcer de noter que les libéraux ne sont pas tous des puristes. Alors qu'au moins un brillant texte ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)) permet de rendre compte des miracles de la science moderne (avant les années 1960) en terme d'initiatives individuelles guidées par une main invisible (nous y reviendrons), il est bafoué par les nouveaux libéraux pour qui il est quand même beaucoup trop pratique de pouvoir lui dire quoi chercher. Mais est-ce vraiment le cas ? Plus d'un pourrait s'y perdre avec cette science Frankenstein dont nous héritons ([Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)). L'OCDE nous guide cependant ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). L'État devra maintenant écouter ceux que les \"stakeholders\" — un nom qui a le mérite d'être éclairant — veulent que l'on cherche. Ces derniers sont des acteurs du privé et des citoyens a qui il faudra envoyer des signaux d'engagement en se montrant flexibles et en financant les projets vers les directions qu'il souhaitent. \n\nCette régression — dont les premiers néolibéraux mettaient déjà en garde ! ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)) — qui consiste à réduire la science à des mécanismes de marché ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) prend cette forme simple: la demande en recherche (du privé ou du public) doit être assouvie par l'offre scientifique sous forme de \"missions\". Bien que la recherche soit en pratique centralisée, l'État ne doit plus que transmettre des instructions, c'est-à-dire permettre de refléter dans l'attribution des financements de projets la demande de la société et des entreprises privés. Aux Pays-bas ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)), les citoyens posent leurs questions scientifiques sur internet. Elles sont regroupées automatiquement par un logiciel de traitement de mot, filtrés (par un processus qui m'est incconu) et ensuite considérées comme des priorités scientifiques. Peut-être n'y a-t-il pas d'erreur plus cruelle que de considérer ce processus comme démocratique. \n\nNous pourrions soulever d'autres inquiétudes regardant la corrélation négative entre l'activité de recherche des industries privés et de leur participation grandissante dans le processus d'orientation de la recherche public. ([Arora2018](reference/Arora2018.md)) Où se déroule la recherche qui leur est nécéssaire si ce n'est en interne ? Un gouvernement assez complaisant pour augmenter le crédit d'impôt recherche des entreprises qui en font de moins en moins, pourrait s'avérer complaisant dans l'établissement de priorités de académiques et fonction des appétits des plus gourmands. Produire des connaissances scienifiques grâce à de l'argent public et dans l'intérêt du privé et avec l'aval du gouvernement s'apparenterai à un véritable pillage organisé de fonds public. \n\nRésumons nous. Répondre à la question de Grothendieck un demi siècle plus tard demande de dire ce qu'est la recherche scientifique aujourd'hui.\nNous avons vu que depuis les années soixantes, la science occidentale est canalisée par les États qui lui donne d'abord des priorités, puis des missions. L'idéologie sous-jacente est la croyance en le fait qu'une technologie est bonne par nature: elle est le moteur de la croissance économique, renforce la compétitivité, et le bonheur des citoyens. Le but de la science est naturellement de parvenir à cette chose ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). Le projets de recherche se technicisent depuis 50 ans, c'est-à-dire plus d'une carrière académique. Le tournant néolibérale du XXIeme siècle ne libéralise pas la science comme elle l'était au début du siècle mais la malmène en y amenant toute sorte de compétition artificielle qui dégrade sa qualité. Elle instaure un marché où l'État ne décide plus des priorités mais il doit incarner le mécanisme qui transmet les demandes des parties civils et privés en offre de recheche pour les scientifiques. \n\n\n#### Biologiser la technique et dialectiser les sciences\n\nLes premiers interessés par la technique ont été les paléontologues et non les philosophes des sciences. On comprend en effet différement l'outil quand on le regarde comme moyen pour un organisme vivant ou comme finalité d'un processus scientifique. Comprendre cette intersection entre biologie et technologie est au coeur de la problèmatique de l'Anthropocène où la technique permet au vivant de s'autodésorganiser. Nous relèverons seulement un aspect marquant de cette pensée qui est celui de considérer l'objet technique comme prolongement du corps, organe supplémentaire d'un organisme qui lui donne une fonction particulière ([Canguilhem1992b](reference/Canguilhem1992b.md)). \n\nPartons de ce paradoxe apparent. En utilisant les lois de la physique et ses méthodes, nous parvenons à faire naître dans un univers régit par les seules lois de la mécanique une entité matérielle qui peut éxécuter un mécanisme précis étant donné une utilisation précise. La formation de la machine a lieu dans un univers où l'on s'efforce d'éliminer toute forme de vie ou variations imprévisible. Mais quand l'objet technique est terminé, il est projeté dans la biosphère. Et ce nouveau monde n'est pas régis par les mêmes règles, bien que ces dernière soient *compatibles* avec les premières. \nL'objet est créé en utilisant l'épistémologie de la mécanique, et il se trouve jeter dans un monde régit entropique, où il s'abimera, s'érodera, et ses parties se decomposeront, etc. Sa finalité sera étendue de manière impréscriptible par des organismes biologiques qui le detournement de sa fonction première pour qu'il puisse servir leur propre finalité. Il y a donc une instabilité profonde pour un objet technique dans un monde pour lequel il n'est pas conçu.\n\nOr l'humain évolue biologiquement et socialement par l'objet technique (feu, écriture, outils, machines, ordinateurs, etc.). S'il se plie aux mécanismes de la machine sans les comprendre il se prolétarise (selon Marx) et automatise son comportement. Pour résoudre l'incompatibilité, il se place dans l'univers de celle-ci et devient *homo computans*, désindividué qui agit mécaniquement (selon Simondon). Il est l'extension organique qui s'inscrit dans le prolongement mécanique de la machine. À l'inverse, il peut être le *virtuso*, l'artisan, le pilote de l'outils mais ceci demande d'amener la machine dans son monde biologique et social, c'est-à-dire l'accompagner d'une pratique individuée (un art spécifique du geste qui n'est plus conscientisé et simple application protocolaire générique) et de règles ou coutumes (pas de feu sans surveillance, pas de lame à l'enfant, etc.). Faire cela nécéssite obligatoirement des savoirs biologiques ou anthropologiques. \n\nNous venons donc de voir qu'un objet technique est projeté malgré lui dans la biosphère à laquelle il n'appartient pas car il est construit par des humains qui font justement absraction du vivant pour le fabriquer. Il doit donc être contextualisé et adopté pour y trouver sa place. En dépassant l'idée d'une bonté essentielle de l'objet technique et en le considérant comme un *pharmakon*, drogue à la fois remède et poison, on peut donc amorcer une réponse à la question de Grothendieck en dialectisant deux fonctions de la recherche scienifique. L'une, technique, permet de construire la machine, l'outils, la technologie. L'autre, non-technique, permet de générer des savoirs qui préservent l'organisation vivante et sociale qui l'utilise, en prenne *soin* ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). \n\n#### Juste une science technicisée et un savoir mal partagé ?\n\nPourrait-on alors expliquer l'Anthropocène par une technicisation des sciences où les savoirs biologiques, anthropologiques seraient relayées au second plan ? Peut-être, mais l'explication peine à convaincre. Les biologistes diagnostisent bel et bien les catastrophes une à une. Ils peuvent identifier les éléments responsables ([Ripple2017](reference/Ripple2017.md)) .Il paraît clair qu'il faut *arrêter* certains gestes et on trouve la cause de certains phénomènes délétaires. Mais pourquoi sommes-nous toujours \"en retard\" ?  Nous diagnostiquement toujours a posteriori les effets néfastes. La législation, quand elle passe l'obstacle des lobbies, se fait des années après les faits, toujours bien après les faits. Bien que les scientifiques aient les capacités d'identifier après le crime qui était la victime et comment s'est déroulé le meurtre, elle ne semble pas paraitre le contenir. Un exemple est celui des perturbateurs endocrinien, substance chimiques qui inerfèrent avec la coordination hormonale des métabolismes. Nous avons une liste toujours grandissante de substances nocives mais nous savons que leur combinaison peut être aussi délétaire. Le nombre de combinaison de substances qui nécéssitent de longue et coûteuse études est gigantesque et grandit. C'est seulement après des études sérieuses donc longues, un consensus scientifique clair qu'il est possible d'ésperer passer les obstables de lobbies industriels pour légiférer substance après substance. En attendant les dégats sont immenses. \n\nOn comprend pourquoi, dans ces situations catastrophiques, le premier réflexe est de demander aux scientifiques de réagir vite, d'être au contact des populations pour résoudre les problèmes du terrains. C'est l'instauration d'un marché de la demande citoyenne/industrielle de la recherche et de l'offre de recherche scientifique. Et il n'est pas présent dans les hauts lieux de la politique publique par hasard   ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). Il émerge d'un discours d'intellectuels s'affiliant à Bruno Latour et Isabelle Stengers pour qui les scientifiques doivent descendre de leur \"tours d'ivoires\", \"sortir de leur zone de confort\", se politiser, addmettre que leur savoir n'est qu'un mode de connaissance particulier. Bien sûr, il n'ont pas la vulgarité de proposer un marché de la science mais cette concception est, malgré elle, pourtant si proche : \"les scientifiques ne doivent pas créer leur propres problèmes\". Alors que leur diagnostique sur l'état dégradé de la science technicisée et malmenée est globalement le même que le nôtre, il ne peuvent se permettre d'en tirer les conséquences. Il est en effet difficile, dans un monde où le concept de vérité est si fragile, de tirer d'une main les citoyens vers les chercheurs et leur sciences, tout en critiquant leur modes opératoires. Bien que nous partageons de bien des façons leurs convictions qui touchent à la néccessité pour les scientifiques d'intervenir dans le débat public, à l'importance d'explorer d'autres types de connaissances, où de poliiser les sciences en technocratie, nous devons nous opposer à cette externalisation du problème de l'Anthropocène en dehors des sciences.  \n\nCette pensée conçoit amplement le renversement philosophique majeur que l'Anthropocène demande. Mais encore une fois, en ne voulant toucher au fond épistémologique du problème, ils doivent construire une pensée sur une métaphysique de la nature ou sur des savoirs technicisée. Par cette inadéquation fondamentale entre le vivant et ses principes d'explication, ces philosophies ne sont pas assez convaincantes à notre goût car elles doivent improvisée toutes les choses alors inconcevables scientifiquement. Si l'on veut dépasser le simple fait que des milliards de bactéries \"habitent\" dans notre estomac, on retrouve trop rapidement de l'intelligence pour les arbres, des connexions entres animaux, etc.. Nous pensons que, pour notre culture occidentale, ces philosophies, n'ont pas de racines empirico-logique assez profondes pour convaincre les citoyens d'une culture occidentale qui s'est construite avec de tels besoins. À l'inverse, nous pensons que c'est en germant dans une théorie scientifique rigoureuse et donc circonscrite, que des idées viennnent à diffuser plus généralement dans les pensées et ouvrir de nouvelles façon de concevoir notre monde. Le gène, la sélection naturelle, la mécanique Newtonienne, sont autant d'exemples qui ont marqué pour le meilleur et le pire les philosophies occidentales. \n\nNous critiquons une vision des sciences qui devrait répondre à des besoins. C'est à dire qui doit étudier un problème existant et y trouver les causes. Autrement dit, c'est une vision inductive des sciences — incarnée par ce marché qui suppose l'existence préalable des choses qui émettent des signaux — qui nous condamne à arriver toujours \"en retard\" sur les problèmes. Peut-on réellement imaginer trouver de véritables solutions à nos problèmes si nous nous contentons de soigner les conséquences de nos maladresses ? Les acteurs incarnant les aspects destructeur du capitalisme ont pour but le profit et non la fin de la vie humaine. C'est leur maladresse plus ou moins pardonnable qui en sont la cause. À l'image du joueur d'echec professionel qui ne voit plus que les bon coups sur l'échiquier et ignore inconsciemment les mauvais, il semble plutôt que nos \"bons coups\" incluent en fait les plus délétaires pour le vivant en général. Bien que celà n'exclue en aucun cas tout autre activité militante à tous les niveaux, il faut aussi *et surtout* s'attaquer au problème à la racine : nous ne savons pas parler scientifiquement d'un organisme vivant. \n\nOr dès que cette question épistémologique concernant la biologie doit passer l'analyse, des premiers signes nous interpellent. Cette discipline décerne son prix Nobel 2020 à J. Doudna qui serait capable de \"reprogammer\" le vivant et \"contrôler l'évolution\" ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). La théorie biologique sous-jacente qui accepte cette affirmation péremptoire et erronée ne révèlent-elle pas ses limites ?  Ne repose-t-elle pas toujours sur une vision mécaniciste de la nature qui, sous forte influence de la physique, lui emprunte son épistémologie pour se donner de l'autorité ? Au lieu de s’émanciper à un moment charnière de son histoire, la biologie a plaqué le langage et l’imaginaire de l’informatique sur le vivant lors de la découverte de l’ADN ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)). Notre entrée dans l'Anthropocène s'explique au moins en partie par notre épistémologie désuète de la biologie ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)).  \n\nRésumons. Un courant de pensée considère que pour obtenir le savoir nécéssaire à cesser les destructions de la biosphère (par les technologies ou autre), il faut surtout tisser des liens entres citoyens et scientifiques. Ces liens sont interprétés au niveau politique comme la création d'un marché où l'offre scientifique doit répondre, toujours a posteriori, aux dégats causés et à la demande des citoyens et industriels. Nous pensons au contraire qu'il y a en premier lieu un problème théorique/épistémologique en biologie. Reste à savoir si l'on peut l'expliquer. \n\n\n#### Des chercheurs prolétarisés par les mécanismes du marché de la connaissance\n\nMais, comment alors, expliquer cet absence de renouvellement théorique et épistémologique en biologie ? Bien que malmenée et technicisée, la science n'en est pas obligatoirement privée de réflexivité. Pour comprendre celà, il faut absolument lire la République des Sciences de M. Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)). Initialement physico-chimiste, membre de la société du Mont-Pelerin, frère de Karl Polanyi et ami de Friedrick Hayek, ce personnage atypique livre une description du fonctionnement de la science jusqu'en 1962. Inspiré par la main invisible d'Adam Smith, il se démarque avec brio de la vision mécaniciste du système de marché, en décrivant une organisation basée sur l'ajustement mutuel d'initiative indépendantes. Il y décrit la mise en oeuvre réciproque d'une autorité locale qui permet de donner crédibilité à l'entière opinion scientifique. Il souligne l'orthodoxie dialogique (conformisme/contestation) — prenant source dans le système démocratique — qui apprend à ces fidèle à contester ses propres règles en recourant leur originalité. Il insiste sur le paris irréductible qu'est la recherche scientifique et qui progresse vers une direction inconnue. La science est pour lui une tradition, c'est-à-dire qu'elle est spécifique et historique, et produit nécessairement des résultats impréscriptibles et non determiné \n\nOr l'analyse de Polanyi est éclairante car elle nous permet de comprendre la double fonction de l'*interprétation* *contextuelle* des critères de mérites (originalité, conformité) à laquelle les scientifiques doivent continuellement procéder grâce à l'opinion scientifique en vigueur. La première fonction de ce travail qui consiste à synthétiser l'histoire jusqu'aau jour donné d'un ensemble supra-disciplinaire de connaissances pour choisir un sujet original mais atteignable. La deuxième fonction est de pouvoir juger le travail d'un pair qui a fait le même travail, *sur ces seuls critères subjectifs* , quand bien même ses conclusions en soi légèrement ou complètement différentes. \n\nQue se passe-t-il quand, à ces deux critères purement épistémique (originalité, conformité), est ajouté un troisième qui est extra-scientifque et qui comprend la pertinence vis-à-vis des besoin de la société ? \nElle permet d'ouvrir une sous-pape libérerant la pression de la pluralité conflictuelle qui est pourtant la condition nécéssaire à la science ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md)). Ainsi, la compétition se métamorphose. À l'antagonisme constructif (*anta*: face à face, *agon*: lutte) se subsittue une concurrence (courir vers le même but), libre de ne pas chercher d'obstacle sur son chemin. Alors que scientifiques, en tant que citoyens, se posent des questions globalement similaires *parce qu*'ils appartiennent à une même société, ils s'évitent maintenant en partitionnant les thèmes de recherches proposés. Et la compétition artificielle introduite dans la recherche scientifique ne peut faire qu'aggraver cette tendance et construire ces \"tours d'ivoires\". Dès lors, puisque le critères d'évaluation d'un travail scientifique ne nécessite plus la synthèse des savoirs et l'esprit critique pour juger de l'originalité d'une recherche à un moment donné, ces résultats peuvent apparaître. Ceci est révélé par l'accroissement de l'exponentiation des papiers scientifiques ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)). Mais, et c'est là le point crucial,  il n'est plus nécéssaire pour les scientifiques d'effectuer ce travail de synthèse critique, réflexif et spéculatif, pour choisir un sujet original. Il s'ensuit une stagnation de l'opinion scientifique et une disruption de la recherche qui ne produit plus de théories ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)), c'est-à-dire en autres des résultats qui ouvrent de nouvelles directions ([Boudreau2016](reference/Boudreau2016.md),[Chu2021](reference/Chu2021.md),[Park2023](reference/Park2023.md)) .\n\nLe système de marché, tel que défini par Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) a un but (équilibre de l'offre et la demande) et peut se décrire en utilisant l'épistémologie de la mécanique (en tant que partie de la physique) ([Koppl2015](reference/Koppl2015.md)). Il repose alors sur le modèle de la machine. Or si l'on considère que le travail d'un scientifique est avant tout de *poser* les \"bonnes questions\" — qui seront impréscripteblement pertinente pour la société puisqu'il y appartient ! —, notre analyse montre que les politiques publiques de recherche depuis un demi-siècles ont déléguer ce rôle aux mécanismes du marché. Les chercheurs sont prolètarisés au sens de Marx ([Marx2005](reference/Marx2005.md)). \n`\n\n[^1]: \"If governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation.\" (OECD, 1966: 8) \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/private/drafts/on-science-organization/Hayeks-mechanistic-economy-of-knowledge":{"title":"Hayek's mechanistic economy of knowledge","content":"\n\n[note on Hayek1945](note/note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)\n\nWe sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:\n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)\n\nAccording to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (e.g. raising political conflicts). For this reason, the organization should keep knowledge decentralized. \n\nA finite set of economic actors are all inclined to consume or produce various finite sets of goods. This parametrizes their field of visions which need to overlap one another (T1). The state of those actors is described by their variable consumption and production of goods. The state of the latter is their variable price (T2), and their flexibility is parametrized.\n\nTo reach the global equilibrium of the economy, local actors only need to differentiate their local consumption or production of goods. Hayek's main idea is that to know in what way they need to do it, they only need their personal knowledge — \"which by its nature cannot (...) be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form\" — and an additional shared information, a price, that couple them to the rest of the economy. Alone, or without prices, an economic actor does not receive any information and she does not change her production or consumption: her state is inertial (T3). When goods have prices that can be changed by producters, if (and only if) economic actors act to maximize their profit, the variation of prices become instructions that determine the actions of individuals and regulate the economy[^1] (T4). For instance, if the price of a commodity of one's interest increases, one reduces its consumption of it and buy more of similar but different one. \n\nFor Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actors. For knowledge to be the most efficiently used, competition should be maximized and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation (T6). \n\nThis very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md).

Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Michael was first of all a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a close friend of Hayek. In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek. Let's understand why. \n\nPolanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. This metaphor comes with a cumulative view of knowledge that we will endorse here: discoveries are made when you work hard enough to unturn stones. This implies a space of potential discoveries in which some of them have already been made. (see Fig.1) \n\nThe state of explorers can be defined on the frontier of the known discoveries subspace. Indeed, researchers maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, when a new discovery is made, an explorer adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the *scientific standards:\n\n1. Plausibility\n2. Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.\n3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists\n\nScientific standards associate two complementary and antagonistic logics: stability and variation (or \"conformism\" and \"dissent\"). This duality shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. \n\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists (or \"overlapping neighborhoods\") allow them to enforce the scientific authority which results from a *contextual interpretation* of the scientific standards. This includes project selection by fundings and the peer-review process of preprints. Because each scientist respect this authority locally, she endorse the overall fragmentized _scientific opinion_ that is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals.\n\nIn turn, because the scientific opinion change throughtout time, so does the interpretation of the scientific standards by researchers. This makes science traditional (that is historical and specific) because new directions for knowledge to grow (in this simple cumulative view where chronological order implies logical superiority) are chosen by numerous subjective individuals that have access to imprestatable discoveries. \n\n\nWhile Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchange of information between scientists is made by scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey instructions to reach a known goal. Explorers don't need discoveries to work per se — they give them a better directions to look at — so they are not inert when left alone. \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  \n \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/private/drafts/on-science-organization/article-epistemological-mismatch":{"title":"article epistemological mismatch","content":"\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nI posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. \nHayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. \nI argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process. \n\n## Introduction \n\n\n## Definition of a mechanistic organization\n\n![mechanistic system (detailed)](concept/mechanistic%20system%20(detailed).md)\n\n![mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md)\n\n## Two examples\n\n![Hayek's mechanistic economy of knowledge](private/drafts/on%20science%20organization/Hayek's%20mechanistic%20economy%20of%20knowledge.md)\n\n\n\n![Polanyi's Republic of Science](private/drafts/on%20science%20organization/Polanyi's%20Republic%20of%20Science.md)\n\n\n## Today's research through the prism of mecanization \n\n\n### The shortest history of science\nResearch activities carried out before the 60's were convincingly described by Polanyi using market-inspired models. The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a \"commited\" and \"flexible\" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions \"stakeholders\" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant.

In contrast, market needs one (an \"accident\" to which to  react) to change its prices ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)). Once the market has operated those changes, prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. Making research activities offer respond to external demand is a first characteristic of marketisation.  When ending a project, we usually have unresolved questions. However, they never have been so clear and we are convinced that they are good questions. Whitin this respect, we can consider that asking relevant questions is one of the central capacity of a researcher. However, scientists can lose their capacity to design original research projects, if they are not accepted.  The loss of the capacity to design original research projects, because this role has been conferred to the market mecanisms. In this process, the art of identifying and expliciting relevant scientific directions is externalized and assured automatically to make the scientific offer meet \"stakeholders\" demand ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). The latter stem from an average of concerns[^1] at a given time, which is constituated by a protocole and takes the form of a \"mission-oriented\" project. This transfer of know-how to a mechanized machinary corresponds Marx's idea of proletarization ([Marx2005](reference/Marx2005.md)), extended to the capacity to design following Stielger ([Stiegler2012](reference/Stiegler2012.md), [Alombert2021](reference/Alombert2021.md)).

In *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith posits the equivalent of Gallileo's inertial principle: \"It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can, (...)\" ([Smith1887](reference/Smith1887.md)). This principle is framing capitalism, because it implies that people are lazy and that they work if and only if they are paid ([Schwartz2015](reference/Schwartz2015.md)). In contrast, Merton posited another principle for research: \"the pursuit of science is culturally defined as being primarily a disinterested search for truth and only secondarily, a means of earning a livelihood.\" ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). Merton therefore acknowledge a principled momentum due to curiosity. We can also including Polanyi's reference to scientific standards (originality within the rules). Depending which principle about human nature is adopted, science policies change and the vocabulary with it.  In one case, the \"scientific workforce\" is given \"incentives\" to which it \"responds\". Researchers do not ask interesting enough questions and one must prompt them to take more risks ([OECD2021a](reference/OECD2021a.md)). Management practices come into play to maximize productivity such that the \"awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause\" make them \"proud of being European\" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/)), \"an incentive for surpassing oneself\" ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). On the other hand, adopting the second principle, it is acknowledged that research is grounded in human's curiosity. Therefore, science policies would reflect on how to maintain this curiosity productive, be it by encouraging specific lifestyles and advise against other (such as too much work), reflect on how researchers collaborate, etc. \n\n#### Symmetrization of individuals and consequences for distinguishing\nIn biographies, we depict scientists (a fortiori famous one such as Einstein, Bohr, Curie) as being original, excentric, not playing by the rules, within a real specificity etc. On the other hand, the scientific workforce does not refer to this. In this view, the scientific \"workforce\" is commutable, discoveries do not depend on specific researchers. This focus the attention on the quantitative aspect of research such as the concentration of elementary and identical — or unidimensionallized (good or bad) depending on the output rate — scientists in specific domains. This builds on the dominant positivist philosophy in Science that consider their subjectivity as a noise when probing the natural world. This loss of individuality is translated in impersonal format of scientific articles, in the name of objectivity. The structure of scientific articles (IMRaD) contextualize a single unbiased observation to transform it into knowledge. They gather easy-to-find informations to communicate more efficiently ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). This reveals a cumulative view of knowledge — already present in Polanyi's puzzle metaphor —  and points to a market-like communication of information. In contrast, experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world. It is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from a subjective interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon. Also, using the informational language implies that the receiver and the emeter are left unchanged during the process. This is absolutely not the goal in research, where one should be at least in part surprised in reading articles.\n\nOnce, they are all the same, how to distinguish them? By merit. \nSimilar individuals that compete with one another, resorting to individualism and \"commercial morals\". \nPeculiar and heterogeneous individuals collaborating with each other to produce robust scientific knowledge. \nThey are all self-interested agents.\n\nIndividualism and \"commercial morals\" instead of collaboration are consequences of symmetrization\n\nResearch make sense only as a collective work and one's work always builds on others. In this tradition, the \"mutual adjustement of independent initiative\" stage actors that are \"self-interested\" only to a given extent, because the work they produce is by construction dedicated to other researchers ([Chavalarias2020a](reference/Chavalarias2020a.md)). As division of labor prevail upon overlapping neighborhoods, researchers compete to publish for a third party (*concurrence*), and not for themselves (*complementary* or *antagonism*). In a way, less attention is provided to the robustness of the results, pedagogy, plausibility of promises ([Audetat2015](reference/Audetat2015.md)), reproducibility ([Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md)) or even integrity ([Fang2012](reference/Fang2012.md), [Edwards2017](reference/Edwards2017.md)). Bibliometrics index and other tools to create artificial competition have unsurprinsingly confirmed Goodhart's law ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)). In fact, Merton ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)) already predicted that competion beyond the \"natural\" linear regime — i.e. competition to get the priority of a discovery for reputation — deteriorates science. Despite policy makers willing to instaure a climate of \"Darwinian selection\" bewteen scientists ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)), evidences linking a lower quality of science due to, for instance, rushing keep cropping up ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Yong2018](reference/Yong2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)). The process of fostering individualism and egoism also relate the neoliberal market spirit in research, through the concept of \"commercial morals\" ([Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)). In a word, it relates to the pitfall of self-evaluating your research based on the rationale that \"my scientific production is good *because* it is accepted by journals\". Making good research is then assimilated to the capacity of getting your papers accepted in specific journals. In a market system, where there is \"a moral justification for selfishness (...)\" ([Hayek1979](reference/Hayek1979.md)), this behavior would indeed (supposedly) participates in building the greater good. In fact, economists of science tackle fraud from a purely individualistic perspective by evaluating risks/benefits ratio[^2]. Following this line, \"selling your research\" is an activity that is encouraged in order to convince researchers or journals by all means. Such practices (oversimplification, omission, camouflage, etc.) can only harm the collective scientific activity in the long-term. \n\n#### Taylor's division of labour prevail upon Polanyi's overlapping neigbourhood (separability)\nOverlapping neighborhood ensure shared expertise on a specific subject. It is the place where the authority of scientific standards is ensured and where critical thinking takes place. In fact, we can understand the peer review process described by Polanyi's scientific standards, with Morin's dialogical principle, that is the association of two complementary, antagonistic and competitive logics (conformism and dissent here). Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity that cannot be reduced to mere juxtaposition of the two. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. When modifying the dialogical nature of the scientific standards by defining a third criteria such as relevance with respect to societal needs, the complementary aspect and the *antagonism* (*anta* which is face-to-face and *agônisma*, struggle) no longer play a role. Efforts are canalized within the third heteronome aspect that solely permit *competition* (*concurrence*, *concourir* in french), a race toward the same objective. This effect can certainly be related to the \"epistemic drift\" described in ([Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md)). This semantic turn allows us to articulate a regime of theoretical disputes for the best arguments on common subjects to a regime where free competition gives you the liberty to isolate yourself from existing competition. This allows you to create a new specific field, far from competition to optimize your chance of having the priority over a discovery ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). According to Morin, the most fundamental condition for science to exists lies: \"what must be absolutly safeguarded is the conflictual plurality in a game that obeys empirico-logical rules\" ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md), p. 24). We should understand Morin's idea not only as a sufficient but also necessary condition. When this \"epistemic drift\" becomes important, the overlapping neighborhood area decreases and we enter a regime of division of labour, that is \"scientific\" organization of reasearch. The allocation of grants will be \"optimize\" in order to avoid \"risk of duplication\" and 'limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). \n\n*Everything happens like if, under the requirement of participating to at least one match of a infinite box competition, you allowed the possibility of chosing the referee position. You are no longer guaranteed that matches still take place.* In fact, the need to argue and defend you research requires the need to reflect about it. You need to find arguments. Having an adversory prompts you to prepare, look in the history of science, see that others  points of view exists, fix you non-scientifiic ideas about it, etc. \nThe separation between philosophy and science swepping out reflexivity from the scientific activity. Scientific disciplines have a long history, they use specific methods and rely on metaphysical assumptions. Elementary history and philosophy of science helps in replacing the scientific activity for the cultural \"tradition\" it is, gaining intellectual hygiene against the believe of creating the sacred and universal Truth. Moreover, theoretical thinking is a crucial activity that play a central role in science, specifically when renewing fields of research. Theories defines observables how phenomena that require explanation ([Longo2016](reference/Longo2016.md)). The \"self-renewal\" of disciplines depends on this reflexive and critical activity, whose down side is to have a low productivity compared to empirical approaches. Biology ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)) and psychological sciences ([Muthukrishna2019](reference/Muthukrishna2019.md)) are both experiencing important such problems. An industrialized research jeopardize its existence by focysing on productivity, neglecting theoretical thinking. The partition of science, without theoretical controversies, does not encourage reflexivity, and that can leave fields in state of *theory disruption*, as recently suggested ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). \n\n\n#### Automaticity is automatically the mean and the goal of research  \nThe so-called \"linear model for innovation\" (or its new extension that encourages to blur those frontiers) relates the pathway from research to technologies: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear chain extends to economic growth. \n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003eIf governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. ([OECD1966](reference/OECD1966.md) , p.8)\n\nIf the goal of the scientific enterprise is growth and international competitivity since the 60's — which it still is ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)) —, research *de facto* aims at building technologies since then. To justify such a goal, OECD S\u0026T policy makers maintain a unambiguous and therefore naive view of technology. For instance, a long policy paper on robots concludes that \"Progress in robotics will help to make life easier, richer and healthier.\" ([Nolan2021](reference/Nolan2021.md)). From this perspective, all technologies are good, an opinion that seems to remain valid in the new \"responsible innovation\" paradigm ([Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)). Making automatons (e.g. machines, programs, protocoles, etc.) is therefore the unquestionned long-term goal of science. This drives basic research to look for mechanisms in nature. Also, this encourages saving only the operational part of theories. From *logos*, they become *techné* ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md), [Stiegler2021](reference/Stiegler2021.md)). The intensive trend for the protocolization of research (usually to make it more reproducible) hide the automatic adoption of unknown black-box tools and can therefore reduce theoretical thinking. This confusion between objectivity and automaticity also reveals itself in the important synthetic process of review articles, which are not qualified as original research, except when computational meta-analysis are performed ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). Last but not least, a infinitly powerful artifical intelligence making correlations will not replace the work of scientists ([Calude2017](reference/Calude2017.md)), despite the willing of ([Anderson2008](reference/Anderson2008.md)) and others inclined to this pervasive idea. \n\n\n\n[^1]: Another possibility that is not considered by policy makers and that would be different from this averaging is to take random directions from citizens or industrials. However, the pertinence of such directions is doubtious. \n[^2]: The realistic validity of such models is of course doubtious when they conclude that the \"publish-or-perish\" paradigm *reduce* misconduct.

We know the colors of a new painting. \nWe are not surprised by the material composition, as if we were told its composition, we would not be surprised at all. \n\"The painter used a frame of 40x40, the color blue, the chord F#\". \nArtisitic is a sort of composition of elements. (Poincaré). No material elements is created (due to principles of physics). \nHowever, we can assemble things so that to create something new. What is new, then ?\nThis is not a mere materialistic assemblage, because we have just stated that no one would be surprise to learn that the artists used this color, make this shape, used this musical pattern, etc.\nIn fact, given a two dimensionnal shape (let's say square shape), we could actually draw all possible paintings, all photos. Of course, technique of paintings may be important, the texture, etc. Suppose that we can generate any colors on a 4k sceen, and -let's take some advance— we can also generate any \"texture\" on this screen. The paintings of Raphaël or just one of all the possible picture we can generate. Does it mean that nobody would no longer draw something new? \nThere is something strange here, as Bergson pointed out. Is it the same thing to define generically a painting (with material considerations ?)\n\nLet's now reduce the problem to a more concrete one :  the chess game. I'm not assuming that chess is an art, but we will be able to understand some crucial aspects with it. I'm assuming that the reader knows the principle of the game. How would you play if you were to begin? How did you play the first time? Somebody told you the rules. Each  time the turn was yours, you would eventuallly try all possibilities and evaluate if it were good or bad moves. Would you believe someone telling you that you can do new things in chess ? Not really.\nHow come professional chess players can say that somedy invented something or created a new move? After all, such as for painting, there is no surprise in chess, there is a finite (and particularly low) number of move at each step. All games can be written down by a machine. We can even think of a big book that write all chess games down. How then, could someone dare say that he invented something when there is a book that has already written down its novelty? How does an artist dare to say that it has created a new image when when it is already stored on a large server somewhere? All music have already been produced, on the next server. \n\nThis is because novelty should always be understood with respect to a specific context. \nA professional chess player will tell you that, to play, he does not evaluate all moves: he only considers the good ones (at middle of the game). \nHe does not consider the bad ones. Then he rapidly chooses between the two or three moves that he only considders. You try 20 of them. \nTherefore, everything happens as if she was choosing (among three of four move) that are the only viable move, to him.\nFrom all pre-possiblities, she restricted real possiblities by a holistic evaluation of the board.\nFrom where this space of possibilities reduction come from? \n\nThe implicit reduction of possibilities is possible only thanks to a specific context, that can only be understood thanks to the history of the player.\nHere, history refers to the training of the chess professional that plays a crucial role in reducing the space of possibilities.\nTo understand this space of possibilities, you will need to understand the physical individual, how it works in its current environment, but also its history in it environment. Those space of possibilities are therefore highly specific to the individual.\n\nIn fact, in chess, the game is so simple and the moves so restricted that all professional players think about practically the same things. What is a novelty then? A novelty is something outside the implicit space of possibilities, but that can be adopted within. It was therefore a priori excluded and seemed impossible. A novelty is specific to individuals, but if they share and explicit to themselves their similar space of possibilities, they would agree about what is new.\n\nDoes A.I. can be creative? Can A.I. produce a novelty? First, if you give the machine all moves that were done by humans, you will see no novelty. What about supervized learning? We first need to define what is the implicit space of possibilities for a machine. If we understand it as the result that it will return during the learning process, then it will itself produce novelties by trials and errors. Such as a human making a random move on a board and evaluate it afterwards. There is a very thin chance that it discovers a novelty that he will adopts, but after millions of try, it is possible. This is what the A.I. does, however it need rules. \n\nChess players find some moves they find interesting in chess games between computers. They are novelties (to them). Therefore, humans, thanks to A.I. can be better at chess, because it opens new possibilities. But, chess is easy because there are explicit mathematical rules. The outcome is \"winning\" or not. This is not art. A machine can easily learn how to play perfectly the game. In fact, the pre-possibility space is very small. \n\nIn art, there are no rules and the pre-possibility is so large and outcome so nuanced that machine will never be able to explore possibilities for us. \"Rules\" evolve, which means that there are no fixed rules like in physics. How would you define possiblities?\n\nWhat does Midjourney do? It generates pictures that ressembles existing ones. It will be able to find patterns that are outside what we thought to be art. For instance, it needs to find shapes, theses are the rules it constructs for itself. It finds rules according to previous pictures and generate something that might be outside what could be thought in our culture. However, art does not reduce to materialistic considerations, can you sum up a piece of art to its materialistic aspect? Of course not and this is what Marcel Duchamp understood. How can you think about something that retrieves a materialistic aspect but is not computable? Numeric images can all be computed, paintings all be drawn. What does it say about our history? What does it say about who we are? We have done everything not to do something. What cannot be generated on a computer or a machine ?\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/private/random/projet-th%C3%A8se":{"title":"","content":"## Comission CNRS  \n\n**Comission 52** : Environnements sociétés: du savoir à l’action\n\nL'institut pilote de la CID est l'**Institut d'écologie et environnement**\n\n-   Changements globaux : dynamiques spatiales et temporelles ; perturbations et crises ; adaptations et résilience ; mitigation ; nexus causes naturelles/causes anthropiques\n-   Nature, écosystèmes, biodiversité : représentations ; savoirs locaux ; scenarii ; modélisations ; conservation ; protection\n-   Systèmes socio-écologiques : genèse et trajectoires ; fonctions et services ; régulation et gestion\n-   Ressources naturelles : valorisation ; usages et gestion ; conflits ; prospectives\n-   Ecologie globale : écologie aux interfaces des sciences du système terre, de la vie et de la société ; transdisciplinarité\n-   Ecologie de la santé : concepts OneHealth, EcoHealth ; interactions environnement-santés-sociétés ; pollutions ; exposome ; dysbioses ; maladies émergentes ; etc\n-   Science de la durabilité : transitions environnementales ; stratégies de développement durable ; énergies ; solutions fondées sur la nature ; ingénierie écologique ; chimie durable ; innovations sociales ; villes durables ; etc\n\n**Comission 54** : Phénomènes fondamentaux et propriétés collectives du vivant: développements instrumentaux, expériences et modèles physiques\n\nL'institut pilote de la CID est l'**Institut de physique**\n\n-   Assemblages d’objets biologiques individuels et leurs interactions : propriétés émergentes et fonctions, systèmes modèles\n-   Interaction ondes et matière vivante: concepts et instrumentation émergents\n-   Capteurs, micro-systèmes et instruments, embarqués et communicants, dédiés à l'observation et l'étude de la dynamique et de l'évolution des individus, des populations, et des écosystèmes\n-   Application de l'activité du vivant aux enjeux de société (frugalité, durabilité) : biomimétisme, bio-inspiration, transformation, conversion\n-   Couplage et rétro-action de la signalisation et de la biomécanique dans les systèmes complexes: système immunitaire, architectures cellulaires et tissulaires\n-   Mesure, quantification et analyse de la matière active appliquée au vivant\n-   Approches physiques pour la neurobiologie et les sciences cognitives, comportement et perception\n\n\n## École doctorale\n\n\n**ED 227** — Science de la Nature et de l'Homme : évolution et écologie;  — Muséum d'histoire naturelle. \n\nBiologie, médecine et santé - 39%  \nSciences agronomiques et écologiques - 24%  \nSciences humaines et humanités - 16%  \nChimie - 12%  \nSciences de la terre et de l'univers, espace - 11%  \nSciences de la société - 5%  \nPhysique - 1%\n\n\n**ED 515** — Complexité du vivant — SU (PSL)\n\nGénétique, de la génomique, de la biologie cellulaire et du développement, de la microbiologie et de l’immunologie, de la biochimie, de la biologie structurale, de la biologie des systèmes, de la biologie évolutive.

Bernard, homeostatis et cybernétique, Piaget, Varela, Kauffman, Rosen) qui termine par les travaux du groupe ORGANISM. \nPuis, à partir de cela, il y a les travaux de principalement Maël, mais aussi Matteo (voir aussi Guiseppe et autres). \n\n**Quel genre de travail ?**\nC'est un travail très original et assez marginal pour la communauté scientifique. Il peut s'étaler sur tout un spectre qui va du renversement ontologique à une application pratique, en passant par un changement épistémologique ou un renouvellement théorique. \n\n- Ontologie : \nSi la science explique les régularités de systèmes (entendu ici comme constitués de parties), alors elle l'a presque toujours expliqué grâce à la régularité des parties et de leur interactions. Ici, il est proposé de l'exprimer avec la variation de ces parties et leur organisation stabilisante. C'est une autre vision de l'être (vivant) pour la science. \n\n- Épistémologie :\nDépart des méthodes de la physique. \n\n- etc. qui en découle. \n\n**Quel pièges ?** \n\nLe changement dépasse le cadre biologique, c’est à dire que les implications vont au-delà de la biologie mais aussi économie, technique, etc. \n\nOn est d’accord pour dire que la meilleure façon de transformer les choses, c’est de créer des théories solides dans un contexte donné et bien précis. Ensuite, et seulement ensuite, elles diffusent dans le reste des idées et étendent les manières dont on pense d'autres problèmes. \n\nCes choses là, qui montrent que ce travail est plus que nécessaire, ne doit pas (me) faire aller dans l’éparpillement:\n\n-   À prendre des outils sans les comprendre profondément. De ne pas être solide: il faut être deux fois plus rigoureux. \n-   Faire une histoire du physicalisme ou voir un paradigme physicaliste partout à critiquer.\n\n**Premier contenu**  \n\n**Stabiliser** ce que Maël a fait avec les autres qui travaille sur dans cette direction **depuis ta thèse** en prenant les éléments essentiels avant ta thèse. **Enlever le gras.** \n**Articuler ensemble les différents concepts** et de les mettre en relation, dans leur spécificité et dans leur ensemble et de les mettre en contraste avec l’épistémologie de la physique :\n- clôture de contrainte, fonctions\n- mesure en biologie, identité\n- nouveauté, historicité et variation\n\nLes mettre en **contraste spécifiquement et globalement** avec l’épistémologie de la physique. Cette partie est peut-être pas passionnante pour Maël mais c'est un support pour toi, solide connaissance pour moi, un socle commun avec les autres. Gros article de review, une bonne partie de ma thèse, début d'une monographie peut-être plus vulgarisatrice, etc. \n  \n**Deuxième contenu** \n\nSur quelque chose qu'on aura forcément plus de recul à choisir à la fin de la première partie. Mais, ça peut être la question de mémoire dans le sens de Rovelli. (mémoire et entropie et temps caracéristique). \n\n\n## Forme \n\n- Travailler avec des gens à un rythme régulier. \nJ'aime travailler seul et en autonomie. Mais ma première thèse s'est passé sans intéraction avec mes directeurs pour la deuxième moitié et ils m'interdisaient d'en parler pour des raisons des priorités et ensuite COVID. Bref, j'étais seul et 1) problème sur le fond parce que altérité et critique toujours bonne et 2) aussi ça fait du bien quand quelqu'un peut voir ce qu'on fait, ça donne un sens humain. C'est la possibilité de pouvoir **discuter** **formellement et informellement.** \n\n##### un qualité\n- Faire des liens avec des choses diverses. Génération d'hypothèses.\n##### un défaut\n- Ne pas trop vouloir faire trop et/ou trop vite. J'ai tendance à vouloir embrasser toujours trop ou toujours plus, jusqu'à épuisement. Cela peut se transformer en un travail qui perd en qualité pour couvrir plus de terrain, ça peut être de l'éparpillement. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Alombert2021":{"title":"Alombert2021","content":"\n#### **Vocabulaire de l’Internation: Introduction aux concepts de Bernard Stiegler et du collectif Internation**     \nby Alombert A., Krzykawski M.

We find that publications by company scientists have declined over time in a range of industries. We also find that the value attributable to scientific research has dropped, whereas the value attributable to technical knowledge (as measured by patents) has remained stable. These trends are unlikely to be driven principally by changes in publication practices. Furthermore, science continues to be useful as an input into innovation. Our evidence points to a reduction of the private benefits of internal research. Large firms still value the golden eggs of science (as reflected in patents), but seem to be increasingly unwilling to invest in the golden goose itself (the internal scientific capabilities). Managerial summary: There is a widespread belief among commentators that large American corporations are withdrawing from research. Large corporations may still collaborate with universities and acquire promising science-based start-ups, but their labs increasingly focus on developing existing knowledge and commercializing it, rather than creating new knowledge. In this article, we combine firm-level financial information with a large and comprehensive data set on firm publications, patents and acquisitions to quantify the withdrawal from science by large American corporations between 1980 and 2006. This withdrawal is associated with a decline in the private value of research activities, even though scientific knowledge itself remains important for corporate invention. We discuss the managerial and policy implications of our findings.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Arrow1962":{"title":"Arrow1962","content":"\n#### **Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Invention**     \nby Arrow K.

As a first step, we raise several questions with regard to the possibility of ‘responsible’ innovation and point at several difficulties which undermine the supposedly responsible character of innovation processes, based on an analysis of the input, throughput and output of innovation processes. It becomes clear that the practical applicability of the concept of responsible innovation is highly problematic and that a more thorough inquiry of the concept is required. As a second step, we analyze the concept of innovation which is self-evidently presupposed in current literature on responsible innovation. It becomes clear that innovation is self-evidently seen as (1) technological innovation, (2) is primarily perceived from an economic perspective, (3) is inherently good and (4) presupposes a symmetry between moral agents and moral addressees. By challenging this narrow and uncritical concept of innovation, we contribute to a second round of theorizing about the concept and provide a research agenda for future research in order to enhance a less naïve concept of responsible innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Boolos2007":{"title":"Boolos2007","content":"\n#### **Computability and Logic**     \nby Boolos G.S., Burgess J.P., Jeffrey R.C.

In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of frontier scientific research projects. We argue that the “intellectual distance” between the knowledge embodied in research proposals and an evaluator’s own expertise systematically relates to the evaluations given. To estimate relationships, we designed and executed a grant proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized the assignment of evaluators and proposals to generate 2,130 evaluator–proposal pairs. We find that evaluators systematically give lower scores to research proposals that are closer to their own areas of expertise and to those that are highly novel. The patterns are consistent with biases associated with boundedly rational evaluation of new ideas. The patterns are inconsistent with intellectual distance simply contributing “noise” or being associated with private interests of evaluators. We discuss implications for policy, managerial intervention, and allocation of resources in the ongoing accumulation of scientific knowledge.\n            This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Brillouin1951":{"title":"Brillouin1951","content":"\n#### **Maxwell's Demon Cannot Operate: Information and Entropy.

The present study proposes some concepts to think about scientific dynamics, through the modeling of the relation between science policies and scholars’ exploration–exploitation dilemmas. Passing, we analyze in detail the effects of the “publish or perish” policy, that turns out to have no significant effects in the developments of emerging scientific fields, while having detrimental impacts on the quality of the production of mature fields.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Chavalarias2020a":{"title":"Chavalarias2020a","content":"\n#### **Mirage de l'excellence et naufrage de la recherche**     \nby Chavalarias D., Huneman P.

Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion. These findings suggest fundamental progress may be stymied if quantitative growth of scientific endeavors—in number of scientists, institutes, and papers—is not balanced by structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas.\n          , \n            In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Clauset2017":{"title":"Clauset2017","content":"\n#### **Data-driven predictions in the science of science**     \nby Clauset A., Larremore D.B., Sinatra R.

Yes, the owner will say, the vessel is not its planks but the relationship between them. Similarly, Antoine Danchin argues in this provocative book, life itself is not revealed just by its components--DNA, ribosomes, genes, cells--but also by their relationships. By the end of 2001, almost 500 genome programs were completed or under way. Drawing upon what researchers worldwide are learning from the gene sequences of bacteria, plants, fungi, fruit flies, worms, and humans, Danchin shows us how genomes are far more than mere collections of genes. They are the means of transmitting the system of relationships making up a living cell from one generation to the next. Genomes are codes that govern the construction, operation, and survival of cells. The Delphic Boat shows us that life is both a complicated piece of chemical machinery that decodes genomes and a process that builds this machinery. The laws of physics or chemistry can only predict so much of this process. To truly understand life, we must understand spatial and temporal relationships between molecules that make up the cell, and how these molecules are coordinated. Danchin persuades us that if we can reach this level of understanding of genomes, we will be able to resolve the major biological puzzle of the twenty-first century: the enigma of the living machine that creates the living machine.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Davies2006":{"title":"Davies2006","content":"\n#### **The Rise and Fall of the Neo-liberal University**     \nby Davies B., Gottsche M., Bansel P.

If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Elzinga1997":{"title":"Elzinga1997","content":"\n#### **The science-society contract in historical transformation: with special reference to “epistemic drift”**     \nby Elzinga A.

It is argued that the broadening of the Kuhnian concept of the paradigm, making it amenable to science policy studies, was an important move. Further development of this notion, however, standed on the prongs of critique coming from both the worlds of politics and science. At the same time, advances in the cognitive sociology of science undermined the internalist/externalist distinction. Today, with certain changes in the conditions of research due to the introduction of the concept of ?strategic research?, politicians are more apt to accept certain points of the thesis; scientific communities, on the other hand, perceive new threats to their autonomy. This paper tries to make sense of this new situation by translating the question of interplay between internal and external dynamics of research into one involving boundary management and epistemic criteria. The notion of ?epistemic drift? is introduced and the internalist/externalist distinction refurbished in neo-institutionalist terms, making use of the concept of interfoliating credibility cycles.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Estrada2013":{"title":"Estrada2013","content":"\n#### **Graph and Network Theory in Physics.

However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart’s Law, according to which, “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Results In this study, we analyzed \u003e120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal’s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of \u003e2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Fischer2009":{"title":"Fischer2009","content":"\n#### **Michael Polanyi's Republic of Science: The Tacit Dimension**     \nby Fischer F., Mandell A. (2009)         \n*Science as Culture* 18: 23-46       \nDOI: 10.1080/09505430802705889     \n\n**Abstract**:  Michael Polanyi spent his long career thinking and writing about the workings of science and the scientific community. Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay, ‘The Republic of Science’. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the tacit dimension in knowledge formation—or what he described as ‘personal knowledge’. On the one hand, his political essay supports a classical conservative position, while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's own ‘fiduciary community’—in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Society—shaped his theoretical conceptualization of the so-called ‘republic of science’. In this way, Polanyi's political contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political thought.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Fodor1974":{"title":"Fodor1974","content":"\n#### **Special Sciences (Or: The Disunity of Science as a Working Hypothesis)**     \nby Fodor J.F.

Research is discussed, if at all, as part of the rhetoric on technological innovation. In many respects, research has disappeared as an autonomous object. This chapter documents a key moment in history, in that it was an occurrence responsible for the marginalization of research in scholarly and public discourses. Beginning in the 1960s, a diversity of scholars and practitioners began to question the role of research in contributing to socio-economic progress. They did so by choosing innovation as a key concept. Innovation in this view is a social or holistic process that includes far more than research. In this chapter, I give social existence to a discourse of the 1960s and 1970s, now forgotten but emblematic in the intervening decades, that marginalized research as a perceived source of socio-economic progress.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Godin2020":{"title":"Godin2020","content":"\n#### **The idea of technological innovation: A brief alternative history**     \nby Godin B.

(2020)         \n\n**Abstract**:  This paper investigates how competition to publish ﬁrst and thereby establish priority impacts the quality of scientiﬁc research. We begin by developing a model where scientists decide whether and how long to work on a given project. When deciding how long to let their projects mature, scientists trade oﬀ the marginal beneﬁt of higher quality research against the marginal risk of being pre-empted. The most important (highest potential) projects are the most competitive because they induce the most entry. Therefore, the model predicts these projects are also the most rushed and lowest quality. We test the predictions of this model in the ﬁeld of structural biology using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for structures of large macromolecules. An important feature of the PDB is that it assigns objective measures of scientiﬁc quality to each structure. As suggested by the model, we ﬁnd that structures with higher ex-ante potential generate more competition, are completed faster, and are lower quality. Consistent with the model, and with a causal interpretation of our empirical results, these relationships are mitigated when we focus on structures deposited by scientists who – by nature of their employment position – are less focused on publication and priority.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Holton1975":{"title":"Holton1975","content":"\n#### **On the Role of Themata in Scientific Thought**     \nby Holton G.

It challenges the idea that world is “simple.” To the reductionist idea that each process is the sum of the actions of its components it opposes a holistic view (the whole is more than the sum of the parts). The aim of the present article is to analyze the epistemological status attributed in the science of complexity to several fundamental ideas, such as those of scientific law, objectivity, and prediction. The aim is to show that the hope of superseding reductionism by means of concepts such as that of “emergence” is fallacious and that the science of complexity proposes forms of reductionism that are even more restrictive than the classical ones, particularly when it claims to unify in a single treatment problems that vary widely in nature such as physical, biological, and social problems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Jakkaraju2003":{"title":"Jakkaraju2003","content":"\n#### **Role of stretch in activation of smooth muscle cell lineage**     \nby Jakkaraju S., Zhe X., Schuger L.

Thus, there are no entailing laws of economic dynamics. In this sense, economic dynamics are creative and the economy is not a causal system. Because economic dynamics are creative, the implicit frame of analysis for the econosphere changes in unprestatable and non-algorithmic ways. New-venture, social, and political entrepreneurs solve the frame problem of the econosphere. Economic evolution is unpredictable, not entailed, and the number of things traded (‘cambiodiversity’) increases over time. Our metatheoretic framework points out how institutions, entrepreneurs, and disparate actors enable what we call ‘novelty intermediation’. We provide examples of novelty intermediation from Rennaissance Italy to Silicon Valley. Our framework does not automatically provide clear policy prescriptions in part because our main result is negative. It may nevertheless provide a useful prolegomenon to a future economics ﬁt for a creative world.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.474920396Z","tags":null},"/reference/Krenn2022":{"title":"Krenn2022","content":"\n#### **On scientific understanding with artificial intelligence**     \nby Krenn M., Pollice R., Guo S.Y., Aldeghi M., Cervera-Lierta A., Friederich P., dos Passos Gomes G., Häse F., Jinich A., Nigam A., Yao Z., Aspuru-Guzik A.

However, scientists would not be entirely satisfied because they would want to comprehend how the oracle made these predictions. This is scientific understanding, one of the main aims of science. With the increase in the available computational power and advances in artificial intelligence, a natural question arises: how can advanced computational systems, and specifically artificial intelligence, contribute to new scientific understanding or gain it autonomously? Trying to answer this question, we adopted a definition of ‘scientific understanding’ from the philosophy of science that enabled us to overview the scattered literature on the topic and, combined with dozens of anecdotes from scientists, map out three dimensions of computer-assisted scientific understanding. For each dimension, we review the existing state of the art and discuss future developments. We hope that this Perspective will inspire and focus research directions in this multidisciplinary emerging field.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kuhn1970":{"title":"Kuhn1970","content":"\n#### **The structure of scientific revolutions**     \nby Kuhn T.S.

We show, first, that the types of scientific frauds that are observed are unlikely to be representative of the overall amount of malfeasance; also, star scientists are more likely to misbehave but less likely to be caught than average scientists. Second, a reduction in fraud verification costs may not lead to a reduction of misconduct episodes but rather to a change in the type of research that is performed. Third, a strong “publish or perish” pressure may reduce, and not increase, scientific misconduct because it motivates more scrutiny. Finally, a more active role of editors in checking for misconduct does not always provide additional deterrence.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Laillier2022":{"title":"Laillier2022","content":"\n#### **Gouverner la science: Anatomie d’une réforme (2004-2020)**     \nby Laillier J., Topalov C.

The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/LiVigni2021":{"title":"LiVigni2021","content":"\n#### **Histoire et sociologie des sciences de la complexité**     \nby Li Vigni F.

The elaboration of theoretical principles is examined in the light of the rich interactions between physics and mathematics. These two disciplines share common principles of construction of concepts and of the proper objects of inquiry. Theory construction in physics relies on mathematical symmetries that preserve the key invariants observed and proposed by such theory; these invariants buttress the idea that the objects of physics are generic and thus interchangeable and they move along specific trajectories which are uniquely determined, in classical and relativistic physics., In contrast to physics, biology is a historical science that centers on the changes that organisms experience while undergoing ontogenesis and phylogenesis. Biological objects, namely organisms, are not generic but specific; they are individuals. The incessant changes they undergo represent the breaking of symmetries, and thus the opposite of symmetry conservation, a central component of physical theories. This instability corresponds to the changes of the environment and the phenotypes., Inspired by Galileo’s principle of inertia, the “default state” of inert matter, we propose a “default state” for biological dynamics following Darwin’s first principle, “descent with modification” that we transform into “proliferation with variation and motility” as a property that spans life, including cells in an organism. These dissimilarities between theories of the inert and of biology also apply to causality: biological causality is to be understood in relation to the distinctive role that constraints assume in this discipline. Consequently, the notion of cause will be reframed in a context where constraints to activity are seen as the core component of biological analyses. Finally, we assert that the radical materiality of life rules out distinctions such as “software vs. hardware.”\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Longo2021":{"title":"Longo2021","content":"\n#### **Programming Evolution: A Crack in Science**     \nby Longo G.

Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a-/-). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood. These data show that hemodynamic force is necessary and sufficient to induce vessel remodeling in the mammalian yolk sac.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Marx2005":{"title":"Marx2005","content":"\n#### **Grundrisse: Foundations of the critique of political economy**     \nby Marx K.

Ideally, useful information expands alternatives, clariﬁes choice and enables policy makers to achieve desired outcomes. Decision makers, however, often lack the useful information needed for good decision-making. By concentrating efforts on increasing the supply of scientiﬁc information, scientists may not be producing information considered relevant and useful by decision makers, and may simply be producing too much of the wrong kind of information. Users may have speciﬁc information needs that go unmet, or may not be aware of the existence of potentially useful information. This paper deﬁnes the practical problem of reconciling the supply of scientiﬁc information with users’ demands so that scientists produce information that decision makers need and use in policy decisions. Literature from a variety of disciplines and topics is reviewed to: explain the goals of reconciling the supply and demand of scientiﬁc information; deﬁne what constitutes useful information; explore lessons learned from experience and describe the characteristics and conditioning factors that shaped those experiences; and identify various alternative strategies and processes that forge stronger science policy linkages. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Medawar1964":{"title":"Medawar1964","content":"\n#### **Is the scientific paper a fraud**     \nby Medawar P.B.

We ﬁrst establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in nonequilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eour central thesis is that organisational closure should be understood as closure of constraints,aregimeof causation which is at the same time distinct from - and related to - the underlying causal regime of thermodynamic openness —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 4) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn contrast to fundamental physical equations and their underlying symmetries, constraints are contingent causes5,exertedbyspecifi —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 4) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003estructures or dynamics, which reduce the degrees of freedom of the system on which they act.

The core of the argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination: biological organisation determines itself in the sense that the effects of its activity contribute to determine its own conditions of existence. We suggest that not any kind of circular regime realises self-determination, which should be speciﬁcally understood as self-constraint: in biological systems, in particular, selfconstraint takes the form of closure, i.e. a network of mutually dependent constitutive constraints. We then explore the occurrence of intrinsic teleology in the biological domain and beyond. On the one hand, the organisational account might possibly concede that supra-organismal biological systems (as symbioses or ecosystems) could realise closure, and hence be teleological. On the other hand, the realisation of closure beyond the biological realm appears to be highly unlikely. In turn, the occurrence of simpler forms of self-determination remains a controversial issue, in particular with respect to the case of self-organising dissipative systems.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe organisation of biological systems is inherently teleological, which means that its own activity is, in a fundamental sense, first and foremost oriented toward an end. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe core of our argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe teleology is extrinsic for the case of artefacts, and intrinsic for the case of biological systems (Jonas 1966) —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eself-determination grounds teleology because it takes the specific form of self-constraint —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003econstraints subject to closure correspond to biological functions. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eif circular causation does not occur as self-constraint, it amounts instead to a chain of transformations in which the system as a whole plays no role in specifying its own dynamics, and these dynamics are sufficiently determined by the external boundary conditions. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eself-constraint implies that the circular organisation specifies its own dynamics: that is why only self-constraint involves selfdetermination, and why biological organisation (by realising closure) is teleological. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003esince the nineteenth century teleology has been replaced by other principles (geodesics, Le Chatelier’s, second law of thermodynamics, attractors...),1 that account for the tendency of physical systems to reach certain stable “goal states”, even under perturbations, without appealing to an inversion of the temporal relation between causes and effects. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 4) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eDarwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection (Darwin 1859), and Bernard’s notion of conservation of the internal milieu (Bernard 1865).

The underlying theoretical framework is that of (mainly French) molecular biology, centred on the notion of program (Jacob and Monod 1961; Mayr 1961; Jacob 1970; Monod 1970). In this line of thought, the concept of genetic program, in the context of Darwinian evolution, rehabilitates teleology (Jacob 1970,p.9)as an admissible scientific dimension. The central idea is that teleological behaviours, which control the form, as well as the adaptivity of biological organisms, are subtended by genetic molecular mechanisms.9 In turn, these mechanisms, by enabling the reproduction of the organism, determine the conditions of its own persistence. In this perspective, therefore, the goal is not extrinsic, but rather intrinsic to the system, since it is specified by a program that determines its future states.

They include a commitment at the highest level of government, strong public-private collaboration in R\u0026amp;D, continuous evaluation and improvement, a “mission-oriented” approach, coherence of policies and flexibility in setting priorities, as well as overall harmonisation and rationalisation of programmes in order to maximise efficiency and reduce duplication.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003eCommitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eMission-oriented” policies aiming to resolve grand societal challenges —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eSystematic evaluation and monitoring enables governments to continuously improve the policy framework and ensure increasing impact over time. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eGovernments need to demonstrate flexibility in setting priorities to be able to respond to increasingly rapid technological and societal evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eAvailable programmes are being harmonised and rationalised, to simplify and optimise target stakeholders’ access to the available subsidies and programmes.

(1988)         \nPerseus Books      \n\n**Abstract**:  Evolution of self-replicating macromolecules through natural selection is a dynamically ordered process. Two concepts are introduced to describe the physical regularity of macromolecular evolution: sequence space and quasi-species. Natural selection means localization of a mutant distribution in sequence space. This localized distribution, called the quasi-species, is centered around a master sequence (or a degenerate set), that the biologist would call the wild-type. The self-ordering of such a system is an essential consequence of its formation through self-reproduction of its macromolecular consti tuents, a process that in the dynamical equations expresses itself by positive diagonal coefficients called selective values. The theory describes how population numbers of wild type and mutants are related to the distribution of selective values, that is to say, how value topography maps into population topography. For selectively (nearly) neutral mutants appearing in the quasi- species distribution, population numbers are greatly enhanced as compared to those of disadvantageous mutants, even more so in continuous domains of such selectively valuable mutants. As a consequence, mutants far distant from the wild type may occur because they are produced with the help of highly populated, less distant precursors. Since values are cohesively distributed, like mountains on earth, and since their positions are multiply connected in the high-dimensional sequence space, the overpopulation of (nearly) neural mutants provides guidance for the evolutionary process. Localization in sequence space, subject to a threshold in the fidelity of reproduction, is steadily challenged until an optimal state is reached. The model has been designed according to experimentally determined properties of self-replicating molecules. The conclusions reached from the theoretical models can be used to construct machines that provide optimal conditions for the evolution of functional macromolecules.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Polanyi1962":{"title":"Polanyi1962","content":"\n#### **The Republic of science**     \nby Polanyi M.

I point out an alternative. The subsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small number of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to depends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe depends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low past entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate of the universe) is non-generic.

In this study, we deploy an approach based on change instead of on levels of inputs and outputs: an approach that to a large extent eliminates the problem of measurement differences between countries. We firstly show that there are large differences in efficiency between national science systems, defined as the increase in output (highly cited papers) per percentage increase in input (funding). We then discuss our findings using popular explanations of performance differences: differences in funding systems (performance related or not), differences in the level of competition, differences in the level of university autonomy, and differences in the level of academic freedom. Interestingly, the available data do not support these common explanations. What the data suggest is that efficient systems are characterized by a well-developed ex post evaluation system combined with considerably high institutional funding and relatively low university autonomy (meaning a high autonomy of professionals). On the other hand, the less efficient systems have a strong ex ante control, either through a high level of so-called competitive project funding, or through strong power of the university management. Another conclusion is that more and better data are needed.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Schrodinger1944":{"title":"Schrodinger1944","content":"\n#### **What is Life?: With Mind and Matter and Autobiographical Sketches**     \nby Schrödinger E.

A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Schwartz2015":{"title":"Schwartz2015","content":"\n#### **Why we work**     \nby Schwartz B.

Other ‘relevance’ pressures include drives for public accountability, pressure for the ‘democratisation’ of science and demands from industry for usable knowledge. Underlying the question of the social relevance of science is the matter of decision-making and quality control in science, usually via the peer-review process. Peer review plays a central role in many of the key moments in science. It is the main form of decision-making around grant selection, academic publishing and the promotion of individual scientists within universities and research institutions. It also underpins methods used to evaluate scientific institutions. Yet, peer review as currently practised can be narrowly scientific, to the exclusion of other pressing quality criteria relating to social relevance. It is often also controlled and practised by scientists to the exclusion of wider groups that might bring valuable perspectives. This article sets out to examine peer review through the lens of social relevance. It challenges peer review as currently practised and makes some suggestions for ways forward.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null},"/reference/Shannon1948":{"title":"Shannon1948","content":"\n#### **A mathematical theory of communication**     \nby Shannon C.E.

And yet, I still had none.\n\nI wasn't alone in that experience. [In my last story](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/366047) I shared why so many people hunt for self-worth in their careers or businesses and end up at best burned out, and at worst in chronic emotional pain.\n\nUrgency. Competition. Measure up. Improve. _More._\n\nWe've been conditioned to believe that if we work hard enough and optimize ourselves, we'll get \"there\" sooner.\n\nThere is no there.\n\nWe think we're evolved human beings in charge of our destiny. In truth, we've been conditioned to work long, fast, and hard to earn the right to feel \"good enough.\"\n\nThere is nothing empowering about it.\n\nCollective unworthiness is the fuel that feeds our society. Humans have turned self-worth into something we need to hunt for, and our careers are a powerful way to pump up our inner metrics. We're desperate for someone or something to validate our existence.\n\nGrinding to the bone has a glaring limitation: self-worth requires no work, is readily available, and free.\n\nNot very catchy, but it's true.\n\nReclaiming your self worth starts with understanding where you've created dependency models, or are hunting for your worth externally. Then it's time to dismantle the systems of oppression.\n\nToday, we'll walk through six ways to help you transform from a \"human doing\" into a human being.\n\nDon't try to do all six. This isn't a competition you can earn self-worth from, or win! Pick the path of least resistance by choosing two that look doable.\n\n## 1. Why am I good?\n\nWrite \"Why am I good?\" at the top of a piece of lined paper. Write a reason why you are a good or worthwhile person on each line. Stop after ten minutes.\n\nYou might find this easy or very, very hard.\n\nNow go through and highlight every reason you're worthwhile that involves you [being productive,](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294922) achieving something, earning money, improving a skill, counting steps on your [Fitbit](https://www.entrepreneur.com/amphtml/363360), or optimizing yourself in some way.\n\nNow go through with a different colour and highlight all the examples of innate worth: things that require zero action or external validation, or are simply traits or qualities you believe to be true about yourself.\n\nCompare the lengths of the lists.\n\nIdeally your second list should be far longer than your first. Sadly, that's rarely the case. [No wonder no one can take a vacation.](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293711) Our identity is on the line!\n\n**Related: [5 Ways to Train Your Brain and Boost Your Self-Esteem](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253898)**\n\n## 2. Am I always \"above and beyond?\"\n\nWe've all worked with someone who always \"goes the extra mile.\" Often they like to talk about it. Loudly.\n\nPerhaps you are that someone!\n\nOffering to do something you weren't asked to do is energy. Staying an extra hour is energy. Picking up someone's slack is energy. Doing out-of-scope work is energy. Staying up late to slam-dunk a design for a client is energy.\n\nEverything we do is an energetic exchange. What are we trading our energy for?\n\nTwo people can do the exact same thing but feel very differently about it.\n\nWhy?\n\nOne person is being generous.\n\nThe other person's worth depends upon it.\n\nWhen you find yourself going \"above and beyond\" here are two blunt but simple questions to ask yourself -\n\n\"Am I doing this because I get to?\"\n\n\"Am I doing this because I want to feel something?\"\n\nIf the answer is the latter, you're in a worth-deficit and people can _feel_ your desperation. Worse, you can feel it. No one wins here. You're also increasing your chances of [burnout.](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/337561)\n\n## 3. Who taught me to work?\n\nThe morality tied to working hard is a product of nature and nurture. I'm the daughter of a kind and generous man who brought a suitcase of files home and slept for two hours a night. When I started a job at a large tech company in my early twenties my supervisor joked about sleeping over to make sure new leads didn't fall out of my [pipeline.](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306343)\n\nExcept he wasn't smiling when he mentioned sleeping bags.\n\nIs it surprising we grow to believe work starts and ends when the sun is down?\n\nWe don't only inherit questionable heirlooms from our parents, [mentors,](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328291) and supervisors. We inherit belief systems that, when left unchallenged, submerge our lives and sink us.\n\nGet curious about the origins of your work ethic. Ask yourself these questions -\n\n-   Who taught me to work?\n-   How happy or healthy were they?\n-   Have I ever challenged these beliefs?\n-   What does work ethic even mean!?\n\n## 4. Boundaries. Boundaries. Boundaries.\n\nEven if we're trying to address our self-worth we're often unconsciously enrolled in a system of oppression. I recently started working with a client who works on two-week-long sprints that bring in $300,000 to the company she works for. In our first Zoom session I saw her eyes darting to where I knew she was getting bombarded with an endless barrage of Slack messages.\n\nWhy couldn't she turn them off? Because she's a wonderful woman who has [no boundaries!](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358918)\n\nAll good design needs constraints. All humans wanting to have innate worth need to be ready to set boundaries around when they are available, restate them relentlessly, and reinforce them ruthlessly.\n\nI have a no weekend work policy in my business. You can email me, but I won't answer until Monday. Sound terrifying? Try it and see if the world burns.\n\nIf it does, you're in a [toxic work environment.](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358814)\n\nIf it doesn't? See where else you can create artificial scarcity around your availability to work. You might be surprised how the quality of your work, and self-worth improves when you channel yourself purposefully, rather than sprawling.\n\n## 5. What's \"enough?\"\n\nMore and enough; there's a difference. You can always do more. You shouldn't if you care about your [mental health.](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/360634)\n\nWhen you professionally define \"enough\" you cut off a self-worth sink-hole.\n\nLight bulbs only last a long time if you turn them off at night. Make a list of what you need to do this week. Cut it in half. Stop working when you're done, even if it's Wednesday. Observe how uncomfortable Thursday and Friday are.\n\n**Related: [Need More Confidence? Here Are 8 Bestselling Books to Get You ...](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314880)**\n\n## 6. Am I on drugs?\n\nWhen did you last sit and do nothing? I mean nothing at all. No working, checking emails, watching television, listening to a podcast, taking a call on a walk, or playing with your dog or kids. What do you feel when you do nothing?\n\nIf your answers are \"never,\" and \"no idea,\" you're on drugs: working-for-worth drugs!\n\nBeing in constant motion numbs us. Most of us are scared of what we'll feel if we stop.\n\nSo try it. Stop.\n\nBlock off two hours, send everyone away, turn your phone off, and sit with yourself. When you start feeling emotionally itchy, note the stories that start arising in the empty space around your worth as a human being.\n\n[Meditation](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/364765) and [breathwork](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358208) transformed my self awareness and worth. Both are key pillars that can support inner work and healing. Building a stillness practice is a powerful way to get to know yourself better. It is one hundred times more powerful than logging hours, dollars, and steps.\n\n## Wrapping it up\n\nStill unsure if you're trying to earn your self-worth? Ask yourself these questions -\n\n-   Do you talk endlessly of rest or time-off, but feel completely unable to take it?\n    \n-   Do you feel compelled to talk about how hard you're working?\n    \n-   Is the completion of a project met with the dread of, \"How can I top this?\"\n    \n\nIf the answer is yes, you have your answer.\n\nAs long as you hunt for your worth in your work, you will be hungry, disempowered, and increasingly desperate. You'll also never be able to retire!\n\nYou can increase your tolerance, appreciation, and even love for yourself by learning how to like yourself while doing nothing.\n\nTreat it all as an experiment through the lens of curiosity.\n\nDo less, be more. See what happens.","lastmodified":"2023-02-13T13:34:12.47892043Z","tags":null}}
