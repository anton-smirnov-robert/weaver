You might find annotations (coming from the PDF) between quotes, don't pay attention to that.\n- **notes**: they are augmented summaries of documents, organized in terms of atomized and linked definitions, concepts, and references. \n\nAs an example, you can check the [literature note on Longo2012](note/literature%20note%20on%20Longo2012.md). \n\nAt the end of each page, you can access the local graph (with depth 2) around your location.\nTo get the big picture, you can also navigate by drag and zoom on the graph that contains all entries. \nTo do so, click on the name of the website in the top-left corner of the page. \nThe website is always in construction, but I try to be consistent when deploying online. \nHere are the technical aspects [[about the website]]. \n\n\n![](images/weaver.png)\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003csub\u003e Image: Village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus).

He pictures not a mecanism but a person — “Turing's architect” according to ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)) Turing introduced ([Turing1936](reference/Turing1936.md)) this machine trying to answer questions regarding decidability. A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers. It requires a (readable, writtable, and movable) infinite 1D bit register — a tape. Turing has shown that those elementary instructions are enough to do elaborate any sophisticated program that are themselves encoded on the tape. The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded. The operating system read the instructions as it computes the program and change the input binary string. Increasing the complexity of the machine (e.g. alphabet, dimensions) does not change the class of functions it can computes ([recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)s). \n\n\n#### Details \n\n**What is the formal definition of a Turing machine ?** \nThe alphabet of the tape $\\Gamma$ can be thought to be 0's and 1's and blank's. \n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\text { A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, }\\left(Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, \\delta, q_{0}, q_{\\text {accept }}, q_{\\text {reject }}\\right) \\text {, where } \\\\ Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma \\text { are all finite sets and } \\\\ \\text { 1. } Q \\text { is the set of states, } \\\\ \\text { 2. } \\Sigma \\text { is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol } \\sqcup \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 3. } \\Gamma \\text { is the tape alphabet, where } \\sqcup \\in \\Gamma \\text { and } \\Sigma \\subseteq \\Gamma \\text {, } \\\\ \\text { 4. } \\delta: Q \\times \\Gamma \\longrightarrow Q \\times \\Gamma \\times\\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\} \\text { is the transition function, } \\\\ \\text { 5. } q_{0} \\in Q \\text { is the start state, } \\\\ \\text { 6. } q_{\\text {accept }} \\in Q \\text { is the accept state, and } \\\\ \\text { 7. } q_{\\text {reject }} \\in Q \\text { is the reject state, where } q_{\\text {reject }} \\neq q_{\\text {accept }}\\end{array}$$\n\n**How to write the program (or diagram or table of instructions) in the machine ?**\n\nWe write $S_0=blank$ , $S_1=0$ and $S_2=1$, $R=move \\ right$, $L= move \\ left$ . \nAn instruction can be written $q_i S_i S_j R q_m$  or  $q_i S_i S_j L q_m$. We encode all instructions that define the Turing machine, as follows $$q_1 S_0 S_0 L q_2 ; q_2 S_1 S_2 L q_3 ; ... $$We write $q_i=DAAAA...A$ ($i$  times), $S_i=DCCC...C$ ($i$  times) and give a integer to each letter (A=1, C=2, D=3,...,;=7).

La méthode scientifique hérite pour le meilleur et pour le pire des visions mécanistes de penseurs de la modernité. Cette conception est intriquée à une épistémologie extrêmement efficace pour l’étude de la matière inerte. La physique est devenue reine en sciences naturelles et d’autres disciplines ont été fortement imprégnées par ses méthodes et les philosophies implicites qui les accompagnent. Ce fut le cas de la biologie. Mais cette discipline pullule aussi de métaphores informationnelles. Les molécules sont des signaux qui sont reçus/émis selon un programme génétique que l'on peut éditer. Les outils de la physique sont utilisés localement pour comprendre le « hardware », moyennant des erreurs qui sont néanmoins reconnues comme importantes pour l'évolution. Cette vision a de profondes implications scientifiques, philosophiques et politiques. Par exemple, la prix Nobel de biologie en 2020 peut conférer à sa discipline la capacité de « reprogrammer » le vivant et « le pouvoir de contrôler l’évolution » car cette affirmation péremptoire (et fausse) n’apparaît pas comme telle dans le cadre de la théorie biologique en vigueur, maintenant bien abimée par de nombreux faits expérimentaux. \n\nPlus généralement, au lieu de constituer une objectivité collective précieuse, une science hors-sol, c'est-à-dire qui n’examine pas son épistémologie et les conceptions philosophiques qu’elle embarque inévitablement, la fragilise. Alors qu’elle doit constituer le cadre permettant l’examen pharmakologique et politique de techniques émergentes, elle promet des « solutions » nano/geo/bio/psycho-technologiques automatiquement adoptées, voire vénérées. Quand le grand public s'aperçoit lentement que les problèmes d'aujourd'hui sont les \"solutions\" adoptées sans débat hier, sa confiance dans le processus scientifique et donc démocratique s'effrite. \n\nDans la fuite en avant technologique d'un capitalisme court-termiste repeint en vert, la science, la permettant, doit porter un regard critique sur les savoirs qu’elle élabore en puisant dans son histoire. Plutôt qu’une désertion devant la résonnance actuelle de la question posée par Grothendiek en 1981 (« Doit-on continuer la recherche scientifique ? »), il est urgent de pænser la science de demain. Cela nécessite une exigence créative et un tâtonnement réfléchi. La rigueur scientifique ne réside pas dans la constance de principes implicites et intemporels, mais dans l'explicitation continues de ses règles évolutives.\n\nLes raisons pour lesquelles notre connaissance du vivant sera cruciale au XXIeme siècle ne manquent pas. La révolution scientifique de la biologie, ratée au siècle dernier, peut s'accomplir si la discipline assume complètement ses spécificités vis-à-vis de la physique. D'abord dans la co-construction indépendantes d'épistémologies et de théories originales du vivant, ensuite dans leurs affrontements sans merci à coup d'arguments empirico-logiques. Le changement profond dont notre société a besoin se trouve une première fois dans ce travail. D'un point de vue opérationelle, une théorie des organismes permettra d'arrêter ce qui, dans une conception candide de notre société, pourrait se nommer \"maladresse destructice du vivant\", à entendre ici dans son sens le plus inclusif. \n\nLe scientisme plaque avec la même autorité scientifique des théories en dehors de leur domaine d'application (comme ces \"lois\" du marché se revendiquant presque exclusivement de la physique). Pourquoi ? Parce qu'un concept rigoureux et circonscrit diffuse subrepticement dans toutes nos idées quand il quitte le papier pour habiter nos esprit-éponges. Il change inévitablement la manière dont nous pensons à d'autres problèmes. Cependant, et cette nuance cruciale est trop souvent ignorée, le jeu de la science demande d'accepter cette intrusion initiale car elle est génératrice d'imaginaire, mais exige en retour de penser le problème différent différament. \n\nSi les dernières décénnies ont déconstruits beaucoup de nos mythes et montrées la contingence de la plupart de nos croyances, elles ont aussi souligné leur nécessité. Il faut retrouver de l'imaginaire collectif, et accepter la transcendance apparente d'un sens que l'on sait sans fondement. L'histoire a montré que les mathématiques puis la physique, toujours en dialogue avec la philosophie ont eu une importance majeure dans l'émergence d'époques car elles ont façonnées des visions du monde. Une théorie des organismes peut avoir comme deuxième fonction, en insufflant en coulisse des idées radicalement nouvelles, reconceptualiser nos modes d'organisation et notre rapport monde. C'est le pari pascalien que je fais. \n\n\u003cp align=\"right\"\u003e Anton Robert \u003c/p\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-12-11T13:00:48.883483316Z","tags":null},"/note/literature-note-on-Longo2012":{"title":"literature note on Longo2012","content":"\n## **Is Information a proper observable for biological organization?**     \nby Longo G., Miquel P., Sonnenschein C., Soto A.M. (2012)   \n*Progress in biophysics and molecular biology* 109: 108-114      \nDOI: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.004\n\nReference: [Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)\n\n\n#### The central dogma of biology was formulated during the thriving era of computer programs.\nThe concepts of (hardware and software-independent) [computability](concept/computability.md), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developped in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (and cryptography played a major role during this period), [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) is an explanation for [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) using the four bases discovered in the DNA.\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologist to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\nIt relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). This view direclty eliminates the radical materiality of living organisms. For instance, Maynard Smith states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e*There is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process* —  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n \n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination.\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very law succes and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e*If a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle.* —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cells to cells, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (hemodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework althought crucial ([Lucitti2007](reference/Lucitti2007.md), [Tang2004](reference/Tang2004.md), [Muller2003](reference/Muller2003.md), [Rot-Nikcevic2007](reference/Rot-Nikcevic2007.md), [Jakkaraju2003](reference/Jakkaraju2003.md)).  \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-11T13:00:48.883483316Z","tags":null},"/reference/Anfinsen1973":{"title":"Anfinsen1973","content":"\n#### **Principles that govern the folding of protein chains**     \nby Anfinsen C.B.

Yes, the owner will say, the vessel is not its planks but the relationship between them. Similarly, Antoine Danchin argues in this provocative book, life itself is not revealed just by its components--DNA, ribosomes, genes, cells--but also by their relationships. By the end of 2001, almost 500 genome programs were completed or under way. Drawing upon what researchers worldwide are learning from the gene sequences of bacteria, plants, fungi, fruit flies, worms, and humans, Danchin shows us how genomes are far more than mere collections of genes. They are the means of transmitting the system of relationships making up a living cell from one generation to the next. Genomes are codes that govern the construction, operation, and survival of cells. The Delphic Boat shows us that life is both a complicated piece of chemical machinery that decodes genomes and a process that builds this machinery. The laws of physics or chemistry can only predict so much of this process. To truly understand life, we must understand spatial and temporal relationships between molecules that make up the cell, and how these molecules are coordinated. Danchin persuades us that if we can reach this level of understanding of genomes, we will be able to resolve the major biological puzzle of the twenty-first century: the enigma of the living machine that creates the living machine.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-11T13:00:48.883483316Z","tags":null},"/reference/Doudna2017":{"title":"Doudna2017","content":"\n#### **A crack in creation: The new power to control evolution**     \nby Doudna J., Sternberg S.

Several philosophers and biologists have argued against adopting this concept based on epistemological and ontological arguments, and also, because it encouraged genetic determinism. While the theories of elaboration and transmission of information are valid mathematical theories, their own logic and implicit causal structure make them inimical to biology, and because of it, their applications have and are hindering the development of a sound theory of organisms.

Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a-/-). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood.

(1944)         \nCambridge University Press      \n\n**Abstract**:  Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger's What is Life? is one of the great science classics of the twentieth century. A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-11T13:00:48.883483316Z","tags":null},"/reference/Shannon1948":{"title":"Shannon1948","content":"\n#### **A mathematical theory of communication**     \nby Shannon C.E.
