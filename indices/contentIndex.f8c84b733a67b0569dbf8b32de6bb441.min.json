It proposes to elaborate methods, know-how and generally applicable guidelines that will allow biologists to make these concepts their own, and use them in practice to generate new knowledge. The epistemological question regards the types of knowledge that one can generate with models stemming from theories that emphasize, for example, the irreducible unpredictability of the variation of organisms or the specific circularity of their organization. Oscillating between modeling and critical reflexivity, this work will mature thanks to methodological experiments that will be the object of scientific publications, and thanks to discussions with several epistemologists concerning the difficulties (inherent or accidental) encountered along the way. By contributing to the understanding of viable organizational modes of material and functional entities, this interdisciplinary work also grounds relevant concepts to think/heal (_pænser_) the Anthropocene.\n\n#### Context\n\nThe Anthropocene is a symptom, at least in part, of a mechanistic view of life. This philosophy (symbolized by the founding thought of Descartes) is today strongly criticized, but biology is slowly moving forward. It is indeed common to hear that we need to “change our relationship with living beings”, rarely that we need new theories in biology. However, in 1913, Radl already noted that a scientist who feels that he belongs to nature and who does not stand before it as before foreign phenomena, is a vitalist—not a mechanist ([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md)). The proximity of contemporary ecological debates to the history of biology should invite us to an epistemological reflection on our current practices. Should we not be alarmed that a theory allows, in 2020, the awarding of the Nobel Prize to someone claiming one can “reprogram” life or “control evolution” ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md),[Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md))? \n\nDismissing mechanism—and its contributions to biology—too quickly would amount to making the same mistake, the one of forgetting the history of science. The excesses of this philosophy are not peculiar to our time, they have been appearing with more or less insistence for several centuries, so that for Canguilhem, vitalism would embody “the permanent mistrust of life in front of the mechanization of life”([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md)). Nevertheless, the omnipresence of interconnected digital artifacts forces us today to deeply rethink the terms of this debate and its stakes. Vaucanson's duck has been digitalized with the central dogma of molecular biology ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)), and any sufficiently “intelligent” algorithm takes shape in a hardware to which we too easily lend life ([Roli2022](reference/Roli2022.md)).\n\nIn science, this dialectic of the organism and the machine is revealed in the mathematical models used to describe the living. Although many people rightfully refuse to assimilate an organism to a machine, most studies carried out in biology resort to the epistemology of physics. For example, one encounters the notion of noise (for measurement), the notion of equilibrium (Hardy-Weinberg), the transfer of information (central dogma of molecular biology), a unimodal probability distribution for allele frequencies (which institutes a deviation from a mean), gene networks described on predefined topologies (Waddington), optimizations to describe morphologies (fractals, surface/volume ratio, etc.), a diversity of programs (genomes) selected by external forces (environment). By using methods adapted to inert matter, we learn about the constituents of a being, about the physico-chemical processes that constitute it, but we do not talk about organisms (bio-_logos_, talking about the living). So, can we properly model organisms? With our machines? How ([Glade2022](reference/Glade2022.md))?\n\nThese questions are not unrelated to the current instabilities of the theoretical framework of biology. The models described above are ways of making it sensible, and thus reveal the physicalist reductionism that underlies it — which posits that _theories_ in biology must be reducible to the ones of physics. The recognition of the influences of development and plasticity of organisms on evolution has challenged the neo-Darwinian approach ([West-Eberhard2003](reference/West-Eberhard2003.md)). Synthetic evolutionary theory, in its extended version ([Laland2015](reference/Laland2015.md)), recognizes non-genetic transmissions, the emergence of phenotypic novelties, the possibility for an organism to modify its environment, and other complexities for understanding the biosphere. Nevertheless, in regaining its validity, this extension hardly provides new fruitful methods. Rather, it weakens itself by tolerating observations that contradict the principles that constitute its core. For a theory to keep its internal coherence while retaining deductive power, it needs rigorous, exploitable and generative principles, that is to say, principles that posit necessities and not possibilities.\n\nA long organicist tradition has seen Claude Bernard, Jean Piaget, or even Francisco Varela try to rigorously define what, in the 18th century, Immanuel Kant had defined as an entity capable of self-organization. Recently, a formal definition grounded in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and bringing together the efforts of the last decades, has been proposed ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md), [Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md)). This work is part of a broader scientific adventure that aims to push the frontiers of biology in new directions ([Bailly2011](reference/Bailly2011.md),[Noble2015](reference/Noble2015.md), [Soto2016](reference/Soto2016.md),[Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md))—beyond the paradigm that conceives of living beings by analogy with machines. Thus, three principles have been posited to describe an organism ([Soto2016](reference/Soto2016.md)). They result from an important epistemological reflection to distinguish biology from physics (or integrate the latter as a singularity into the former). As a reminder, physics studies the changes of the state of a system in a predefined space, on the basis of invariants and symmetries. This discipline is interested in the relations between generic properties of objects (mass, charge, size, etc.).\n\nThe _principle of variation_ posits that biological organisms are specific, that is, the mathematical structure necessary to describe them varies over time in a fundamentally unpredictable way. Since variations relevant in biology are functional, this principle implies that describing an object of study requires talking about its _history_ and _context_, which are unique.\n\nIn parallel to Galileo's principle of inertia, _the default state principle of cells_ is posited: they are motile, and proliferate (with variation according to the first principle, because cells are different from one another). The causes that must be explained by the biological theory are, as in physics, the deviations from the state of inertia. However, we are no longer looking for external forces acting on an object to set it in motion, but for the constraints that act on the cellular default state. We must explain reduced mobility, absence or excess of proliferation, but not motility or proliferation per se.\n\nThe _principle of organization_ emerges from the work that formalizes Kant's idea, as mentioned above. It postulates that organisms are organized in the sense that they realize the _closure of constraint_, where the crucial concepts of biological processes, constraints and functions are rigorously defined. This notion provides theoretical roots for the notion of biological autonomy ([Moreno2015](reference/Moreno2015.md)).\n\nThe changes for science are major, as the regularities of a system are no longer explained by appealing to the regularity of its constituent parts (and their interactions). In this new paradigm, the parts of the system vary intrinsically, and the stability of the system comes from its circular organization. This is an ontological shift (for the living) that opens up truly new and relevant paths. Epistemology, theories, and modeling in biology cannot be reduced to those of physics.\n\nMore recently, the successive articulations of these principles have led to several concepts. First, the concept of anti-entropy which mobilizes the historicity of organisms ([Montevil2020](reference/Montevil2020.md)) and the closure of constraint. Second, the concept of anti-entropy production integrates the notion of novelty with the principle of organization ([Montevil2019a](reference/Montevil2019a.md)). These two concepts, which thus raise the question of biological time (past for history or future for novelties), are also fruitful for rigorously theorizing the concept of disruption in biology ([Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)).\n\nFinally, those concepts, that emerge from theoretical biology, allow us to understand some systemic problems of the Anthropocene ([Montevil2021a](reference/Montevil2021a.md)). Briefly, according to Bernard Stielger and the Internation collective, this period can be characterized by a temporal lag between a technical system and the knowledge necessary for its individual and social appropriation. Thus, the degradation of the biosphere by technologies requires an in-depth rethinking of the functioning of our exosomatic organs ([Lotka1945](reference/Lotka1945.md), [Canguilhem1992b](reference/Canguilhem1992b.md)). Integrating the technosphere into the biosphere requires the ability to describe viable organizational modes of biological and economic processes, i.e., those that resist the degradation of time, i.e., that resist entropy ([Stiegler2021](reference/Stiegler2021.md)). The stakes of an organicist theoretical biology, or more particularly of an organology, are not only epistemic ones, and they have the potential to make a difference in facing today's biosphere crisis.\n\n#### Question and goal of the project\n\nFor this epistemological and theoretical adventure to bear fruit, the work carried out must be put into the hands of biologists with methods. A method is not a mechanical protocol, but a know-how that allows biologist-artisans to appropriate and use in practice theories to generate new knowledge. It is shared by establishing generally applicable guidelines; these are strategies to be interpreted more or less freely, not programs.\n\nThe stakes of this project are not only operational, because it is not obvious that an organicist biology can be so! In an organism, unlike a machine, the existence of its constituents depends on the functioning of the whole. Its parts cannot be isolated, its circularity prevents non-intrusive analysis. Moreover, what can the biologist say in front of novelties, unpredictable by definition? René Thom said, in a clear-sighted burst of physico-mathematician intellectual honesty, that Darwin's theory was not scientific, because the possibilities of evolution were not predefined. The question that underlies the project is then: what kind of knowledge can an organicist biology generate about living beings? The best way to answer this question is to develop a method and discuss its epistemic contributions. We will discuss the nature of the obstacles we encounter in dialogue with relevant thinkers and clarify the modeling difficulties that are intrinsic to an organicist biology.\n\nPragmatically, as an example, a part of physics instantiate its theories by a method that consists in identifying invariants (symmetries, conservation law, etc.) to give a differential equation, specifying initial and boundary conditions, then solving analytically or numerically the problem. The work I propose aims to develop an equivalent for biology studies, based on the principles mentioned above.\n\n#### How?\n\n“Methods come at the end” according to Nietzsche. Indeed, it is necessary to model and experiment to take a critical look, then to pose general and shareable strategies. Our main contribution will therefore only be written after three years, but it requires methodological experiments (and therefore scientific productions) to do so.\n\nToday, most biological models use the tools of physics or statistics to interpret empirical or computationally generated data. In contrast to this inductive approach, the proposed models will have to proceed from the theoretical framework ([Glade2022](reference/Glade2022.md)). This work will necessarily see the emergence of novelties in terms of know-how, beyond a simple combination or arrangement of practices used in biophysics. Some promising initial attempts have been made ([Montevil2016b](reference/Montevil2016b.md), [Bich2020](reference/Bich2020.md), [Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). They are examples of the modeling work we need to do and _then_ generalize to provide transferable guidelines. Discussions and collaborations with the authors of these papers are expected, especially with Matteo Mossio and Leonardo Bich. Before undertaking these efforts, a solid grasp of the theoretical concepts is necessary, as well as a fine appreciation of the epistemological issues involved in modeling in theoretical biology ([Glade2015](reference/Glade2015.md)). Potential collaborators, such as Franck Varenne, can contribute to guide the research, or participate in the epistemological discussion regarding the insights brought by the elaborated methods ([Varenne2013](reference/Varenne2013.md)).\n\nLet us say a little more about the work that will be carried out. The closure of constraint has a valuable diagrammatic representation on which other concepts specific to organisms can be grammaticalized ([Montevil2020a](reference/Montevil2020a.md)). This will be a starting point. It seems that we can distinguish three stages in our future work. First, we will need to understand to what extent the closure of constraint enriches the modeling of biological phenomena ([Bich2020](reference/Bich2020.md)). Can one assemble partial models coming from biophysics to describe the whole organism? What does the organicist view bring to the modeling of the parts? Can we obtain quantitative models? Can the self-determination (in the form of self-constraint) of an organism be numerically implemented? Concrete applications will be produced, criticized and compared to be generalized.\n\nThe incorporation of the historicity of organs into the modeling of organisms is the second Gordian knot of the project. While physics is based on a relational epistemology, biology must integrate the historicity of organisms to define them. Articulated with the principle of organization, the concept of anti-entropy comes into play. Experimentally, new practices have been prescribed ([Montevil2019](reference/Montevil2019.md)), but it is also necessary to introduce a phylogenetic and ontogenetic history into the modeling of the functions of an organism.\n\nFinally, the concept of anti-entropy production refers to the change in the space of relevant observables to describe the living system ([Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). Unpredictable functional variations allow new possibilities and project the organism into a new space of description. The question of temporality will be central here, because the continuous physical time is no longer the relevant observable. The irreducible duration of cycles in the life of organisms (heartbeat, breathing, day, seasons, etc.) prevent laws of evolution based on infinitesimal differentials of time. What can a scientific method tell when it chooses to speak of unpredictable novelties in a conceivable space, rather than meaningless states in a fundamentally non-ergodic system? How can digital machines help the elaboration of an organicist biological modeling practice?\n\n\n#### ==**French version**==\n\n# Méthodes et limites épistémologiques d'une biologie organiciste\n\n\n#### Résumé\n\nCette thèse se propose de faire fructifier un travail théorique qui pose des principes non mécanicistes pour comprendre les organismes. Elle se propose d'élaborer des méthodes, des savoir-faire, des lignes directrices généralement applicables qui permettront à des biologistes de s'approprier et d'utiliser en pratique ces concepts pour générer des savoirs nouveaux. L'enjeu épistémologique concerne les types de connaissances qui peuvent être générées par des modélisations qui procèdent de théories soulignant, par exemple, l'imprédictibilité principielle de la variation des organismes ou la circularité spécifique de leur organisation. Oscillant entre modélisation et réflexivité critique, ce travail murira grâce à des expérimentations méthodologiques qui feront l'objet de publications scientifiques, et grâce aux discussions avec plusieurs épistémologues concernant les difficultés (inhérentes ou accidentelles) rencontrées en chemin. En contribuant à comprendre des modes d'organisations viables d'entités matérielles et fonctionnelles, ce travail interdisciplinaire permet aussi la prise en main de concepts pertinents pour pænser l'Anthropocène.\n\n#### Contexte\n\nL'Anthropocène est un symptôme, en partie au moins, d'une vision mécaniciste du vivant. Cette philosophie (symbolisée par la pensée fondatrice de Descartes) est vivement critiquée aujourd'hui, mais la biologie n'effectue que lentement sa mue. Il est en effet commun d'entendre que nous devons “changer notre rapport au vivant”, rarement qu'il faut proposer de nouvelles théories en biologie. Or, dès 1913, Radl notait déjà qu'un savant qui sent son appartenance à la nature et qui ne se tient pas devant elle comme devant des phénomènes étrangers était un vitaliste — et non un mécaniste ([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md)) La proximité de débats écologiques contemporains avec l'histoire de la biologie devrait nous inviter à une réflexion épistémologique sur nos pratiques actuelles. Ne devrait-on pas s'alarmer qu'une théorie permette l'attribution d'un prix Nobel en 2020 à une personne affirmant pouvoir “reprogrammer” le vivant ou “contrôler l'évolution” ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md),[Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)) ? Ne procède-t-il pas de ce manque de rigueur des choix politiques désastreux — comme la _Genetic Technology Bill_ aujourd'hui ?\n\nCongédier trop rapidement le mécanisme — et ses apports à la biologie — reviendrait à faire la même erreur, celle d'oublier l'histoire des sciences. Les excès de cette philosophie ne sont pas propres à notre époque, ils apparaissent avec plus ou moins d'insistances depuis plusieurs siècles, de sorte que pour Canguilhem, le vitalisme incarnerait “la méfiance permanente de la vie devant la mécanisation de la vie.” ([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md)). Néanmoins, l'omniprésence d'artefacts numériques interconnectés nous oblige aujourd'hui à repenser profondément les termes de ce débat et son enjeu. Le canard de Vaucanson s'est numérisé avec le dogme central de la biologie moléculaire ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)), et tout algorithme suffisamment “intelligent” prend corps dans un hardware auquel on prête trop facilement vie ([Roli2022](reference/Roli2022.md)).\n\nEn science, cette dialectique de l'organisme et de la machine se révèle dans les modèles mathématiques utilisés pour décrire le vivant. Bien que nombreux soient ceux qui refusent à raison l'assimilation d'un organisme à une machine, les études effectivement réalisées en biologie recourent quasiment toutes à l'épistémologie de la physique. Par exemple, on rencontre la notion de bruit (pour la mesure), la notion d'équilibre (d'Hardy-Weinberg), le transfert d'informations (dogme central de la biologie moléculaire), une distribution unimodale de probabilité pour des fréquences d'allèles (qui institue un écart à une moyenne), des réseaux de gènes décrits sur des topologies prédéfinies (Waddington), des optimisations pour décrire des morphologies (fractales, ratio surface/volume, etc.), une diversité de programmes (génomes) sélectionnés par des forces externes (environnement). En utilisant des méthodes adaptées à la matière inerte, on apprend des constituants d'un être, des processus physico-chimiques qui le constituent, mais on ne parle pas d'organismes (bio-_logos_, parler du vivant). Peut-on, alors, modéliser ces derniers ? Avec nos machines ? Comment ([Glade2022](reference/Glade2022.md))?\n\nCes questions ne sont pas sans rapport avec les instabilités actuelles du cadre théorique de la biologie. Les modélisations décrites ci-dessus constituent des manières de le rendre sensible, et révèlent ainsi le réductionnisme physicaliste qui le sous-tend — qui pose que les _théories_ en biologie doivent pouvoir se réduire à celles de la physique. La reconnaissance des influences du développement et de la plasticité des organismes sur l'évolution ont bousculé l'approche néodarwinienne ([West-Eberhard2003](reference/West-Eberhard2003.md)). La théorie synthétique de l'évolution, dans sa version étendue ([Laland2015](reference/Laland2015.md)), reconnait les transmissions non génétiques, l'apparition de nouveautés phénotypiques, la possibilité pour un organisme de modifier son environnement, et d'autres complexifications pour la compréhension du monde vivant. Néanmoins, en retrouvant de sa validité, cette extension n'apporte guère de nouvelles méthodes fructifiables. Plutôt, elle s'affaiblit en se permettant de tolérer des observations qui contredisent les principes qui constituent son noyau dur. Pour qu'une théorie garde sa cohérence interne tout en gardant une puissance déductive, il lui faut des principes rigoureux, exploitables et générateurs, c'est-à-dire qui posent des nécessités et non des possibilités.\n\nUne longue tradition organiciste a vu Claude Bernard, Jean Piaget, ou encore Francisco Varela essayer de définir rigoureusement ce que, au XVIIIe siècle, Emmanuel Kant avait défini comme entité capable d'auto-organisation. Récemment, une définition formelle s'articulant à la thermodynamique hors équilibre et réunissant les efforts de ces dernières décennies a été proposée ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md), [Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md)). Ce travail s'inscrit dans une aventure scientifique plus large qui a pour but de faire rebondir la biologie dans de nouvelles directions ([Bailly2011](reference/Bailly2011.md),[Noble2015](reference/Noble2015.md), [Soto2016](reference/Soto2016.md),[Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md))— au-delà du paradigme qui conçoit le vivant par analogie avec les machines. Ainsi, trois principes fondamentaux ont été posés pour décrire un organisme ([Soto2016](reference/Soto2016.md)). Ils résultent d'une réflexion épistémologique importante pour distinguer la biologie de la physique (ou intégrer la deuxième — en tant que singularité — dans la première). Pour rappel, la physique étudie les changements d'état d'un système dans un espace prédéfini, sur la base d'invariants et de symétries. Cette discipline s'intéresse aux relations entre les propriétés génériques d'objets (masse, charge, taille, etc.).\n\nLe _principe de variation_ pose que les organismes biologiques sont spécifiques, c'est-à-dire que la structure mathématique nécessaire à leur description varie dans le temps de manière fondamentalement _imprédictible_. Étant donné que les variations pertinentes pour la biologie sont fonctionnelles, ce principe implique que décrire un objet d'étude nécessite de parler de son _histoire_ et de son _contexte_, qui sont uniques.\n\nParallèlement au principe d'inertie de Galilée, _le principe d'état par défaut des cellules_ est posé : elles sont _motiles_, et _prolifèrent_ (avec variation selon le premier principe, car elles sont différentes deux à deux). Les causes qui doivent être explicitées par la théorie biologique sont, comme en physique, les écarts à l'état d'inertie. Cependant, on ne cherche plus les forces extérieures s'exerçant sur un objet pour le mettre en mouvement, mais les _contraintes_ qui agissent sur l'état par défaut cellulaire. On doit expliquer une mobilité amoindrie, l'absence ou l'excès de prolifération, mais pas la motilité ni la prolifération en soi.\n\nLe troisième _principe d'organisation_ émerge du travail qui formalise l'idée de Kant, mentionnée plus haut. Il postule qu'un organisme est organisé selon le modèle de _clôture de contraintes_, où les concepts cruciaux de processus, contraintes et fonctions biologiques sont rigoureusement définis. Cette notion permet de donner des racines théoriques à la notion d'autonomie biologique ([Moreno2015](reference/Moreno2015.md)).\n\nLes changements pour la science sont majeurs, car on explique plus les régularités d'un système en faisant appel à la régularité de ses parties constituantes (et de leurs interactions). Dans ce nouveau paradigme, les parties du système varient intrinsèquement, et la stabilité du système procède de son organisation circulaire. C'est un basculement ontologique (pour le vivant) qui ouvre des voies véritablement nouvelles et pertinentes. L'épistémologie, les théories, et les modélisations en biologie ne peuvent être réduites à celles de la physique.\n\nPlus récemment, les articulations successives de ces principes ont conduit à plusieurs concepts. D'abord celui d'_anti-entropie_ qui mobilise l'historicité des organismes ([Montevil2020](reference/Montevil2020.md)) et la clôture de contrainte. Ensuite, le concept de production d'anti-entropie intègre la notion de nouveauté au principe d'organisation ([Montevil2019a](reference/Montevil2019a.md)). Ces deux concepts, qui posent ainsi la question du temps biologique (passé pour l'histoire ou futur pour les nouveautés), sont aussi fructueux pour théoriser rigoureusement le concept de disruption en biologie ([Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). \n\nEnfin, ces concepts de biologie théorique permettent de comprendre des problèmes systémiques de l'Anthropocène ([Montevil2021a](reference/Montevil2021a.md)). Brièvement, selon Bernard Stielger et le collectif Internation, cette période peut se caractériser par un décalage entre un système technique et les savoirs nécessaires à son appropriation individuelle et sociale. Ainsi, la dégradation de la biosphère par des technologies nécessite de repenser en profondeur le fonctionnement de nos organes exosomatiques ([Lotka1945](reference/Lotka1945.md), [Canguilhem1992b](reference/Canguilhem1992b.md)). Intégrer la technosphère dans la biosphère nécessite de pouvoir décrire des modes d'organisation de processus biologiques et économiques viables, c'est-à-dire qui résiste à la dégradation du temps, c'est-à-dire à l'entropie ([Stiegler2020](reference/Stiegler2020.md)). Les enjeux d'une biologie théorique organiciste, ou plus particulièrement d'une organologie, dépassent ainsi le cadre de la science.\n\n#### Question et objectif du projet\n\nPour que cette aventure épistémologique et théorique puisse fructifier, le travail effectué doit pouvoir être mis entre les mains de biologistes avec des _méthodes_. Une méthode n'est pas un protocole mécanique, mais un savoir-faire qui permet à des biologistes-artisans de s'approprier et utiliser en pratique des théories pour générer des savoirs nouveaux. Il se partage en établissant des lignes directrices généralement applicables; celles-ci sont des stratégies qu'il faut interpréter plus ou moins librement, pas des programmes.\n\nLes enjeux de ce projet ne sont pas seulement opérationnels, car il n'est pas évident qu'une biologie organiciste puisse l'être ! Dans un organisme, à l'inverse de la machine, l'existence des constituants dépend du fonctionnement du tout. Ses parties ne sont pas isolables, sa circularité empêche l'analyse non intrusive. De plus, que peut dire le biologiste devant des nouveautés, imprédictibles par définition ? René Thom disait, dans un élan clairvoyant d'honnêteté intellectuelle de physico-mathématicien, que la théorie de Darwin n'était pas scientifique, car les possibilités de l'évolution n'étaient pas prédéfinies. La question qui sous-tend le projet est alors : quels types de connaissances une biologie organiciste peut-elle générer sur le vivant ? La meilleure façon de répondre à cette question est d'élaborer une méthode et discuter la nature de ses apports épistémiques. Nous discuterons la nature des obstacles que nous rencontrerons en dialogue avec des penseurs pertinents et clarifierons les difficultés de modélisation inhérente à la biologie théorique — organiciste.\n\nTrès concrètement, à titre d'exemple, une partie de la physique actualise ses théories et postulats par une méthode qui consiste à identifier des invariants (symétries, loi de conservation, etc.) pour donner une équation différentielle, à préciser des conditions initiales (et/ou aux bords), puis à résoudre analytiquement ou numériquement le problème. Le travail que je propose vise à élaborer un équivalent pour des études de biologie qui se basent sur les principes et les théories mentionnées plus haut.\n\n#### Comment ?\n\n“Les méthodes viennent à la fin” d'après Nietzsche. En effet, il faut modéliser et expérimenter pour porter un regard critique, puis poser des stratégies générales et partageables. Notre contribution principale ne pourra donc s'écrire qu'au bout de trois ans, mais elle nécessite des expérimentations méthodologiques (donc des productions scientifiques) pour ce faire.\n\nLa plupart des modélisations en biologie utilisent aujourd'hui les outils de la physique ou des statistiques pour interpréter des données empiriques, ou computationellement générées. À l'inverse de cette démarche inductive, les modélisations proposées devront procéder d'une mise en pratique du cadre théorique ([Glade2022](reference/Glade2022.md)). Ce travail verra nécessairement l'apparition de nouveautés en termes de savoir-faire, au-delà d'une simple combinaison ou d'agencement de pratiques utilisées en biophysique. Quelques premières tentatives prometteuses ont été réalisées ([Montevil2016b](reference/Montevil2016b.md), [Bich2020](reference/Bich2020.md), [Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). Elles sont des exemples des travaux de modélisation que nous devons effectuer, _puis_ généraliser pour donner des lignes directrices instituables. Des discussions et des collaborations étroites avec les auteurs de ces papiers sont attendues, notamment avec Matteo Mossio et Leonardo Bich.\n\nAvant d'entreprendre ces efforts, une appropriation solide des concepts théoriques est nécessaire ainsi qu'une fine appréciation des enjeux épistémologiques liés à la modélisation en biologie théorique ([Glade2015](reference/Glade2015.md)). De potentiels collaborateurs, comme Franck Varenne, peuvent apporter leurs expériences pour orienter les recherches, ou participer à la discussion épistémologique concernant l'apport des méthodes générées ([Varenne2013](reference/Varenne2013.md)).\n\nDétaillons un peu plus le travail qui sera effectué. La notion de clôture de contrainte possède une écriture diagrammatique précieuse sur laquelle les autres concepts propres aux organismes peuvent se grammatiser ([Montevil2020a](reference/Montevil2020a.md)). Nous utiliserons donc cet atout. Il semble que nous pouvons distinguer trois étapes de notre travail futur. D'abord il faudra comprendre dans quelles mesures la clôture de contraintes enrichit la modélisation des phénomènes biologiques ([Bich2020](reference/Bich2020.md)). Les modélisations biophysiques et bio-informatiques des parties d'un organisme peuvent-elles s'agencer pour la description du tout ? Qu'apporte la vision organiciste pour les modélisations des parties ? de l'organisme ? Peut-on formaliser une modélisation quantitative ? Est-ce que l'auto-détermination (sous forme d'auto-contrainte) d'un organisme est numériquement simulable ? Des applications concrètes seront produites, critiquées et comparées pour être généralisées.\n\nL'incorporation de l'historicité des organes dans la modélisation des organismes est le second nœud gordien du projet. Alors que la physique repose sur une épistémologie relationnelle, la biologie doit intégrer l'historicité des organismes pour les définir. Articulé au principe d'organisation, c'est le concept d'anti-entropie qui entre ici en jeu. Expérimentalement, de nouvelles pratiques ont été prescrites ([Montevil2019](reference/Montevil2019.md)), mais il faut aussi pouvoir introduire une histoire phylogénétique et ontogénétique dans la modélisation des fonctions d'un organisme. Il y aura ici à élaborer des pratiques mixtes, entre la physiologie et l'histoire.\n\nFinalement, le concept de production d'anti-entropie réfère au changement d'espace des observables pertinentes pour décrire le système vivant ([Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). Une variation fonctionnelle imprédictible permet de nouvelles possibilités et projette l'organisme dans un espace de description nouveau. La question de la temporalité sera ici centrale, car le temps continu de la physique n'est plus l'observable pertinente. Les temps irréductibles des cycles qui rythment la vie d'organismes (du battement, de la respiration, du jour, de la saison) prohibent les lois d'évolutions basées sur des différentielles infinitésimales du temps. Que peut apporter une méthode scientifique qui choisit de parler de nouveautés imprédictibles dans un espace concevable, plutôt que d'états dépourvus de sens dans un système foncièrement non ergodique ? Que faire des machines numériques dans l'élaboration d'une biologie théorique rigoureuse ?","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.751890551Z","tags":null},"/Where-am-I":{"title":"Where am I?","content":"\nWelcome!\n\nYou are on my personal website.

A Turing machine is an [automaton](definition/automaton.md) with an unlimited and unrestricted memory. It is a model of everything that can do today's computers. It requires a (readable, writtable, and movable) infinite 1D bit register — a tape. Turing has shown that those elementary instructions are enough to do elaborate any sophisticated program that are themselves encoded on the tape. The Turing machine allocates a data space to make the computation and another one where the programs are encoded.

They are abstract objects sharing some common *properties* (mass, charge, length, etc. ), and that can be permutated while leaving the scientific rationale invariant. For instance, any abstract object of a mass $m$ is generic, because a shoe and an apple with the same mass are *identical* from the point of view of free fall in classical mechanics.\n\nA mathematical equation governs the dynamics of the *state* of an object in a *predefined* space of pertinent observables (e.g., position, momenta, angle, etc.) called *phase space*. All possibilities are given in advance, and a trajectory is only a partial order indexed by a variable that we call time. Equations are valid in the entire phase space. Therefore, equations are not concerned about the specific values of the object's state or propreties, but rather about the *relations* between those quantities. Most physical properties are actually defined in a relational way (charge, mass, solubility, elasticity, etc.), and we can consider that physics rely on a relational epistemology.\n\nAt the core of this physical description of matter lies the cental notion of symmetry, which is invariance under transformation. First, generic objects are symmetric, because they can be permutated while leaving the scientific explanation invariant. Second, the objectivity of phase spaces rely on the invariance of the observables by a suitable transformation of a reference. For instance, Galilean referentials are useful because the dynamics studied in one of them are also valid in others. Lastly, equations are justified using conservation laws that can be linked to  symmetries (Noether's theorem). Fundamentals laws of physics, such as the conservation of energy in mechanics, stem from a time-reversal symmetry. \n\nIn sum, physics understands change (of state of objects) based on invariance (under some transformations). Symmetries are central (for objects, for observables, for time) to extend objectivity by stating what is *identical* (objects, experiments, energy). The trajectory of the state a *generic* object is given as a partial order on a set of pertinent possibilities. It is given by a mathematical equation that is concerned by the differential effect caused by a relation between states and properties of objects, for all possible values defined by the predefined phase space. \n\nSee also: ([Feynman1967](reference/Feynman1967.md),[VanFraassen1989](reference/VanFraassen1989.md),[Bailly2011](reference/Bailly2011.md),[Longo2014](reference/Longo2014.md),[Montevil2016](reference/Montevil2016.md)). \n\n\n![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230320111525.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.755890508Z","tags":null},"/concept/formal-language":{"title":"formal language","content":"\nA formal language consists of:\n- an alphabet  \n- a [syntax](definition/syntax.md) for the alphabet\n\nThere must be a decision procedure (see [decidability](concept/decidability.md)) for membership in well-formed sentences. \n\n#### Source(s)\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.755890508Z","tags":null},"/concept/halting-problem":{"title":"halting problem","content":"\nGiven a [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md) and an initial binary strings, the problem consists in knowing if it will halt or not.

Also, if the realization of the *telos* can be quantified on a line, MOs can fulfill its task more or less satisfactorily.

Thus, $M_s$ may only be seen as a set of pre-possibilities for symphonies and not as a set of explicit possibilities. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11) \n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.759890466Z","tags":null},"/concept/open-ended-evolution":{"title":"open-ended evolution","content":"\nThe unbounded increase in the number of [novelty](concept/novelty.md) that appear during evolution. \n\nSee a definition of life with open-ended evolution : [Ruiz-Mirazo2004](reference/Ruiz-Mirazo2004.md)","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.759890466Z","tags":null},"/concept/protein-folding-problem":{"title":"protein folding problem","content":"\nHow does a protein folds ?

(2020)         \n*Frontiers in Physiology* 11: 611       \n\nReference: [Montevil2020a](reference/Montevil2020a.md)\n\n\n### What is identity? Why defining it?\n\nThe concept identity for organisms can be more or less restricted. The largest is *individuation*, which is having the propreties drawing its own boundaries and discriminating itself from the surrounding.  All organisms fall into the same reference class if identity is defined as such. The narrowest is *unicity*, i.e. having the exactly the same set the properties. They each reference class as one element. In practice we want somehting in between, but it depends on what we want. In the following, the purpose is to do experiments and model organisms.\n\nThey are two conceptions of biological identities. One is rather used in experimental biology. One controls the *historical aspect* of organisms, usually solely the *genealogical* aspect. It has the advantage of using organisms as \"wholes\", despite their complexities. A bat is a bat because it has a given ancestor that was named bat and that it shares with other bats. In experimental biology, [symmetrization](concept/symmetrization.md) is the process of (concretely of epistemically) positing a reference class (see [note on Montevil2019](note/note%20on%20Montevil2019.md)), usually by controlling the history. The limit of this conception is that you do not control how many variations occured before the last ancestor (\"name-bearing type\") or your last control. For instance, snakes are tetrapods because we refer to a common ancestor to name them like that. More generally, we can have no common properties because of variations, and be within the same reference class. However, the implicit but fundamental assumption is that closer in genealogy means closer in organizational terms (thin bottle neck in experimental practices).\n\nOn the other hand, the *relational* aspect says that a bat is a bat if it has the relevant properties of a bat. This makes explicit what are the properties taken into account in modeling or experimental practices with mathematico-physical models. It is usually not properly justified that you can neglect some parts (closure of organisms for instance) or pick certain values of parameters to imitate what you see ([Montevil2020](reference/Montevil2020.md), [note on Montevil2016 and Montevil2020](note/note%20on%20Montevil2016%20and%20Montevil2020.md)). Those mathematical structures are not stable with respect to the flow of time so the identity is *bounded* in time. There are unpredictable variations. This is the crucial problem with this approach whose abstract some parts of the organism. The second problem is that one needs to define what is a bat, therefore taking one specific individual and modeling it as a reference — this leads to a large number of variability which make models useless in practice. Moreover only the aspects that are incorporated in the model are taken into account. Missing aspects (that always play a role because of closure) are forgotten. \n\nOne could choose one or the other view and be satisftied because 1) based on Darwin's view of evolution or 2) just lack of epistemic knowledge but otherwise, it is good. Or we can say that both are need and complement each other. *It is always a matter of perspective.* Be careful not to confuse with synchronic and diachronic, it is not the same mapping. The relational conception has those two aspect, and the genealogical one also. \n\nThe idea is that the genealogical conception provides *whole organisms* as candidates for identity classes. The relational conception, in turn, details the relevant parts for the purpose of the model/experiment.\n\n### Organization approach of the relational conception\n\nThe organizational approach of the relational conception of identity can be more or less inclusive. 1) They all have the same constraints (have the same mathematico-physical structure that constraint the same process) 2) they realize closure. The last definition is important for the identity of the same individual during development. This is *organizational continuity*. We prefer the other aspect. Note that the emphasis is on the qualitaative and not quantitative aspects.\n\nHowever, there is the same problem of having to make explicit the entire closure (though now closure is to be established). Therefore, one uses *partial closure*. It is different from local biophysical models. Same objection: you miss stuffs. Yes but I have closure so I may capture more relevant stuffs (reciprocal stabilization of constraints). \n\nIn some experimental situation, a group of organism can share some *generic* properties. The only way for them to share aspects, here constraints, is from common history. In fact, closure can explain stability across generations ([Mossio2022](reference/Mossio2022.md)). At the evolutionnary time scale, [[concept/natural selection]] provides the rationale. \n\n### Hybrid and bounded identity\n\nTo characterize an identity you need:\n\n- A *generic* description of *partial* closure to *abstract* a group of organisms and their environment (with means other organisms).\n- A *complementary* reference to a *recent* common ancestor to take into account the neglected aspects of the relational model (such as past contexts or fonctions). \n\nFor instance, this makes the distinction between organisms with funcitonnal ==*homology*== and ==*analogy*==, because we need to precise a recent common ancestor say that it is identical. This prevents physicist to analyze the eye of mammal or cephalopods with the same optical model. To be identical means that you have the same historical origin (or hidden numerous relational properties) *and* that you can be described by the same physico-mathematical structure. Therefore your identity is *hybrid*.\n\nThe characterization of closure puts the emphasis on explaining how organisms maintain themselves in time, on stability. It actually determines what kind of variations is likely to be preserved and exclude other (like DNA mutation if you don't look at DNA). In that case, you will have a different functional regime and a change of identity (following our definition of identity). This is way you identity is *bounded* in time. \n\nAlso, while organizational proximity is an unjustified but a fundamental hypothesis in general, the use of closure *provides a theoretical support* for cross-generational organization proximity ([Mossio2022](reference/Mossio2022.md)). In other words, there is an argumentation for the \"short arrow\" in the viable organismal macrostate. If functional novelties take time and variations, you can use for several generations the same common ancestor as a reference. \n\nThe identity class shrinks when the common ancestors is more recent or when the relational aspects are more explicited. \n\n### Introducing $\\chi$\n\n$\\chi$ is all what is not made explicit by the relational description, that is what has not been abstracted. It is a symbol in the etymological sense: it point to a specific and material object of the world. \n\n$\\chi$ is part of the closure. In some sense, $\\chi$  could be unpacked into fully relational aspects that are generic, i.e. shared by individuals that stem from a common descent. However, this is not feasible in practice and would just use $\\chi$ to fill the unknown. At the end of the day, this hybrid identity would be useless. In any case, $\\chi$ is irreducible to fully relational aspect (be it for principled or practical reasons).\n\nRather, $\\chi$  is the reminder that some arguments should be given with a relational description. \n\nUsing $\\chi$  to realize closure makes you think of justifying the closure by giving instances of partial closure with $\\chi$ (see Fig3b). In fact, Fig3a is what is done in biophysics: it is implicitely assumed that closure is realized (i.e. that the result of my simulation maintain the boundary conditions I use) wihtout proper justifications. \n\n\n\u003e[!warning]\n\u003e\n\u003eAnother way to point out one limiting aspect of the epistemology of physics is that you boundary/initial conditions, external parameters of you equation does not depend on the results of your model. You fix it with a steady hand, the one of the manufacturer building the model as an artefact. \n\n\n![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230404124000.png)\n\nThe role that plays $\\chi$  when linked to other constraints depends on what one knows about the organisms. For instance, it can be the place of a rationale for justifying some boundary conditions maintained by processes constrained generically, or how an explicited constrain helps maintaining some other generic process. In cases of partial closure, constraints necesserally have multiple functions. Cases of partial closure are needed to justify the use of biophysical models afterwards. In other words, the starting point is never the relational closure. It is always the hybrid closure with $\\chi$.\n\n![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230405123654.png)\n\nIf, from an identity class or diagram $\\mathcal{D}^0$ you unpack some relational aspects from $\\chi$ , you have a more restricted identity class or diagram $\\mathcal{D}^1$. Depending on what you want to do, you might want to be more general and still use  $\\mathcal{D}^0$. The knowledge of being able to define $\\mathcal{D}^1$ is not lost and you ca define a ==*type*== $\\mathcal{D}^0[\\mathcal{D}^1]$, that is an instance of $\\mathcal{D}^0$ that helps you argue about $\\chi$  without commiting in expliciting it. The idea is to be able to be representative. You can also have more types $ $\\mathcal{D}^0[\\mathcal{D}^{1,1},\\mathcal{D}^{1,2},...]$ to taken into account some diversity. This moves as an epistemological role: it shows that a diversity of explicted different constraints can maintain the same generic process for instance.\n\nLastly, $\\chi$ can accomodate for unpredictable variations that *may appear*. You can define types that are valid *at different times*: $\\mathcal{D}_{t_1}^0[\\mathcal{D}^{1,1}_{t_2},\\mathcal{D}^{1,2}_{t_2},...]$. In other words, $\\chi$ can be used as a \"propulsive constraint\", that is one that promotes the appearance of unpredictable novelties. In other words, we know that something will probably happen, but we don't know what.  However, to discuss the propulsive constraint, you need to use types to make it explicit because e.g. $\\mathcal{D}^{1,1}_{t_2}$  does not include it.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.779890252Z","tags":null},"/note/draft-on-the-decline-of-theorization-in-science":{"title":"draft on the decline of theorization in science","content":"\n==**French version**== \n\n## Résumé\n\nDivers acteurs ont récemment sonné l'alarme concernant le déclin de la capacité des articles scientifiques à faire rebondir la recherche dans de nouvelles directions, c'est-à-dire à proposer de nouvelles théories. Comment l'expliquer à la lumière des politiques économiques de la science depuis les années soixante ? Nous attribuons ce déclin à (i) la diminution de l'intérêt économique du travail de synthèse critique des savoirs existants (ii) la difficulté croissante de ce travail dû d'une perte d'historicité des projets de recherches et des articles scientifiques (iii) l'effacement de la pluralité conflictuelle dans la répartition des projets de recherches et dans les moyens de communication entre scientifiques.\n\n\n## Introduction \n\nAllons-nous continuer la recherche scientifique ? En 1972, Alexandre Grothendieck ouvre le débat ([Grothendieck1972](reference/Grothendieck1972.md)). Les connaissances scientifiques permettent la conception de technologies qui rendent possibles les dégâts toujours plus amples infligés à la biosphère. Si la menace est de nature existentielle pour les êtres humains, pourquoi ne pas cesser l'activité coupable de faire apparaître ces risques ? Les inquiétudes qui motivent cette question, posée un mois avant la publication du rapport Meadows, se sont aujourd'hui multipliées. Elles sont à l'origine du mouvement décroissant qui se targue d'un rationnel physicaliste concernant les limites de notre monde (évolution de la quantité d'énergie, de déchets, de matériaux, de particules, etc.) ou qui se perd dans un relativisme vain. Ici, les maux sont premièrement causés par le productivisme du modèle économique capitaliste — le degré de reconnaissance de sa responsabilité est une variable d'ajustement de partis politiques.\n\nUne autre analyse pense un désajustement entre un système technique et les savoirs nécessaires à son appropriation individuelle et sociale, une période que Bernard Stielger nomme la disruption ([Stiegler2016](reference/Stiegler2016.md)). Ce décalage prend racine dans une vision naïve de la technologie par les autorités gouvernantes : elle est intrinsèquement bonne, la solution aux problèmes sociétaux. Cette analyse n'est pas étrangère à la première, car l'innovation technologique implique la croissance économique dans le paradigme actuel. Elle s'en distingue par la critique épistémologique des organisations mécanicistes que la société adopte, par exemple pour son économie ([Stiegler2020](reference/Stiegler2020.md)). \n\nPour illustrer les effets de la disruption en science, prenons l'exemple de la recherche sur les perturbateurs endocriniens — ces substances chimiques dérivées de produits industriels qui interfèrent avec l'organisation hormonale de nos métabolismes. Une fois que la toxicité d'une de ces molécules est soupçonnée, elle est longuement étudiée par des chercheurs. Après l'obtention d'un consensus scientifique, ces résultats peuvent rivaliser avec les arguments de lobbies industriels dans les oreilles d'instances politiques. La législation arrive bien tard, après que les dégâts sont causés. Or, non seulement la liste initiale de perturbateurs endocriniens s'allonge durant le temps de ce long processus coûteux, mais les combinaisons possibles de ces substances que nous savons différemment toxiques sont aussi multipliées ([Soto2021a](reference/Soto2021a.md)). Ce retard des savoirs (ici biologiques) laisse le goût amer du fatalisme qui corrode nos espoirs d'un avenir post-Anthropocène.\n\nPour sortir de la disruption et trouver des remèdes rationnels à ces problèmes, il est nécessaire de générer des savoirs nouveaux qui changent notre entendement des enjeux liés à la technique et au vivant ([Montevil2021b](reference/Montevil2021b.md)). En science, cela veut dire créer de nouvelles théories. Il semble donc que nous ayons fait un tour sur nous même pour répondre à la question de Grothendieck par l'affirmative. Cependant, divers acteurs ont remarqué, avec leur propre langage, un déclin de la théorisation en sciences naturelles. D'abord au niveau politique et économique où l'on constate des réticences à une recherche risquée ou plus précisément une recherche \"transformatrice\" ([OECD2021](reference/OECD2021.md)), c'est-à-dire \"une recherche conduite par des idées qui ont le potentiel de changer radicalement notre compréhension d'un concept scientifique important\" ([NationalScienceBoardU.S.2007](reference/NationalScienceBoardU.S.2007.md), p. 10). Le caractère conservateur des projets de recherche financés est confirmé par des expériences ([Boudreau2016](reference/Boudreau2016.md)). Des scientifiques rapportent, d'analyses quantitatives sur des dizaines de millions d'articles ([Chu2021](reference/Chu2021.md),[Park2023](reference/Park2023.md)), que leurs productions \"rompent de moins en moins avec les savoirs passés d'une manière à pousser la recherche dans de nouvelles directions\". En biologie et psychologie, des scientifiques distingués dénoncent le manque de théorisation dans leurs domaines ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md),[Muthukrishna2019](reference/Muthukrishna2019.md)). Enfin, il a été suggéré que la science promeut des résultats empiriques qui déstabilisent des théories, mais ne promeut pas leurs renouvellements, de sorte qu'il en résulte une désorganisation des savoirs théoriques ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)).\n\nComment les politiques de la science ont-elles provoqué ce phénomène ? Nous nous proposons d'en donner un rationnel économique en s'aidant du modèle de la République de la Science de M. Polanyi. Après une brève présentation, nous essentialisons deux périodes de politiques des sciences pour modifier simplement ce modèle et discuter ensuite des effets de ces variations sur la théorisation en science. \n\n\n## La République de la Science\n\nAvant les années soixante, l'organisation de l'activité scientifique est correctement décrite par la République de la Science de Michael Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)). Frère de Karl Polanyi, membre de la société du Mont-Pélerin, ce physico-chimiste devenu philosophe des sciences et économiste est un personnage atypique (image photo). En s'inspirant de la main invisible d'Adam Smith, il décrit une organisation non mécaniciste d'explorateurs qu'il distingue explicitement d'un modèle de marché. Nous reprenons très largement son modèle dans les paragraphes suivants, tout en le réduisant schématiquement pour le travailler ensuite. \n\nPolanyi décrit des initiatives indépendantes en ajustement mutuel. Chaque chercheur, en tant qu'acteur économique rationnel, maximise la réputation qu'il obtient en produisant des contributions évaluées au regard des *critères de mérite*. Ces critères suivent deux logiques complémentaires et antagonistes : celle du conformisme (plausibilité, précision, intérêt scientifique du sujet) et celle de l'originalité (degré de surprise des scientifiques apprenant le résultat). L'évaluation de ces critères de mérite est assurée par des scientifiques qui partagent des *zones d'expertise*. Si l'ensemble de ces zones se chevauchent, chaque membre peut se porter garant de l'ensemble de l'opinion scientifique. \n\nLes critères de mérites étant génériques, l'*autorité scientifique* est assurée dans une zone restreinte des connaissances après un processus d'interprétation contextuelle de ces critères que tout scientifique se doit effectuer : qu'est-ce qui est original et conforme dans ma sous-discipline ? Cette autorité, qui se constitue par une *synthèse critique des savoirs existants* (processus (3) en Fig. 1), a une double fonction. Premièrement, elle détermine la sélection des nouveaux projets à financer (1) et des contributions à adouber (2). Ensuite, elle permet à la chercheuse qui a fait ce travail de proposer un projet original pour accroître son mérite. \n\nCette société d'explorateurs — qui se dirige vers une direction inconnue — repose sur une orthodoxie dynamique qui encourage sa propre contestation. Les critères de mérites dialogiques permettent l'amélioration des connaissances, car un nouvel article change le contexte qui détermine partiellement l'autorité scientifique. Cette circularité rend l'activité scientifique *traditionnelle*, c'est-à-dire spécifique et historique, car l'état actuel des connaissances résulte d'une succession de synthèses critiques qui déterminent des choix individuels rationnels. Ils ne peuvent être compris qu'en retraçant l'histoire des contributions et des transmissions locales de savoirs. Enfin, notons que la dynamique de l'autorité traditionnelle repose fondamentalement sur l'originalité de ses membres.\n\n## Les années 60 et l'idéologie techniciste\n\nLa publication de Polanyi est contemporaine à l'apparition d'un intérêt politique pour la science. L'évolution de cette dernière peut être analysée avec \"les bonnes pratiques\" politiques partagées par l'OCDE (l'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques) qui a été et demeure très influente en termes de politique coordonnée d'une science occidentale mondialisée. Néanmoins, ces réformes interviennent sans aucun modèle explicite d'organisation pouvant se substituer à celui de Polanyi et l'ont peut donc considérer qu'elles se superposent au modèle existant. Nous essentialisons ces mesures en termes de variations minimales au modèle présenté ci-dessus, après y avoir résumé les motivations.\n\nDans les années soixante, il est remarqué que les innovations technologiques assurent une rapide croissance économique. Un modèle linéaire d'innovation (recherche fondamentale, recherche appliquée, puis développement et diffusion de technologies) indique qu'il faut financer la recherche fondamentale pour assurer la croissance. Puisqu'il est sous-entendu que la croissance est bénéfique à la société, la science devient un bien public. On ne peut plus la laisser aux mains de scientifiques et le gouvernement doit poser des priorités en matière de recherche. Le projet Manhattan démontre l'efficacité des mesures qui vont dans ce sens. D'ailleurs, dans un contexte de guerre froide, aller sur la lune ou construire une bombe atomique n'est plus qu'une simple question de curiosité ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md), [Godin2020](reference/Godin2020.md)). \n\nNotons la contradiction qui réside dans l'ajout d'une planification centrale pour une organisation basée sur un modèle libéral. Selon Polanyi, une telle autorité conduirait à une science \"à l'arrêt\". Comment cette autorité centrale intervient-elle dans ce modèle ? Nous considérons qu'elle *ajoute* un critère de mérite non épistémique (la pertinence sociétale du sujet de recherche) et qu'elle en choisit le contenu ([Rip1994](reference/Rip1994.md), [Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md)).  L'idée que la recherche — source d'une innovation technologique intrinsèquement bonne ([Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)) — doit être asservie à la croissance économique domine encore aujourd'hui ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). \n\n## L'Ère néolibérale et le retour de la main invisible \n\nLe tournant néolibéral de la science à l'entrée du XXIe siècle ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md), [Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md)) se caractérise par l'introduction d'une compétition artificielle entre chercheurs, par exemple avec des indices bibliométriques générant les effets délétères de la \"loi de Goodhart\" ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)). Un discours ultralibéral souhaite des réformes \"inégalitaire\" et \"darwinienne\" ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)); des pratiques managériales veulent motiver les chercheurs à participer à des projets \"grands et nobles\" — dans le cadre idéologique donné — pour qu'ils puissent se sentir \"fiers d'être européens\" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/)). L'on parle de \"taskforce\" ou \"workforce\" scientifiques pour désigner des individus génériques et interchangeables. Les frontières du modèle linéaire d'innovation s'effacent pour un rapprochement grandissant entre recherche privée et publique. Cette tendance fait écho à la corrélation négative entre l'activité de recherche privée ([Arora2018](reference/Arora2018.md)) et la participation grandissante de l'industrie dans le processus d'orientation de la recherche publique ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). À défaut d'apporter de la science fondamentale dans les start-ups ([Maxmen2019](reference/Maxmen2019.md)), ces dernières ont introduit les \"morales commerciales\" ([Hayek1979](reference/Hayek1979.md), [Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) dans la recherche : une étude, qu'il faut \"vendre\", est bonne *parce qu*'elle est acceptée dans un bon journal. L'élaboration de projets scientifiques s'apparente à un rite de promesses irréalistes ([Audetat2015](reference/Audetat2015.md)) et certains phénomènes académiques évoquent des bulles spéculatives ([Mirowski2012](reference/Mirowski2012.md)). Bien que des chercheurs accumulent des preuves montrant le caractère délétère des politiques dont ils sont victimes ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Sandstrom2018](reference/Sandstrom2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)), le manque de reproductivité et les fraudes explosent ([Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md),[Fang2012](reference/Fang2012.md), [Edwards2017](reference/Edwards2017.md)) dans certaines disciplines[^2]. \n\nCette deuxième période de politique de la science est, elle aussi, en contradiction avec le modèle de Polanyi. Le modèle néolibéral a décentralisé la planification des priorités de recherche, mais dans l'idée d'instaurer un marché de projets scientifiques entre chercheurs et \"stakeholders\" (industriels et citoyens). L'État joue le rôle des mécanismes émetteurs de signaux et d'instructions, qui oriente les fonds publics vers les recherches qui répondent à une demande ([Demeritt2000](reference/Demeritt2000.md), [McNie2007](reference/McNie2007.md)). Le vocabulaire introduit par Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) concernant le mécanisme des prix est repris, de sorte que l'État doit être \"flexible\" pour \"s'adapter rapidement\" au changement. Il doit aussi s'assurer \"d'envoyer de bons signaux aux 'stakeholders' \" en introduisant des projets \"top-down\", c'est-à-dire des \"missions orientées\" vers un besoin urgent de la société ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). Au regard des remarques précédentes, il est légitime de questionner le poids relatif des citoyens quant aux priorités que la science doit adopter. Retenons ici pour notre modèle que le contenu du critère de mérite non épistémique n'est plus issu d'un choix critiquable. Le scientifique doit maintenant s'efforcer, dans l'exercice de son autorité, d'assurer l'équilibre entre la demande (civile, industrielle) qu'on lui communique, et l'offre, c'est-à-dire les projets qui lui sont proposés et qu'il sélectionne (Fig. 1, en rouge). \n\nNous venons de voir que la politique de la science a instrumentalisé la recherche puis a instauré un marché de projets scientifiques. Qu'elle soit un instrument, une machine ou un système qui tend vers l'équilibre, la dynamique de cette organisation ne peut s'expliquer, pour des raisons épistémologiques, qu'en faisant appel à une cause extérieure. Or, les chercheurs exercent toujours leur propre contrôle en allouant les fonds disponibles à des projets qu'ils sélectionnent. Pour dépasser ce paradoxe apparent, il faut comprendre comment l'intériorisation des consignes gouvernementales dans la République de la Science est possible. Une étude plus rigoureuse que la nôtre se doit d'introduire les agences de recherches, ne regroupant en pratique qu'une minorité de chercheurs responsables des choix effectués. Une dimension sociologique importante ([Laillier2022](reference/Laillier2022.md)) serait alors à considérer. Notre approche conçoit ici que la sélection des projets financés se déroule de la même manière que l'examen par les pairs, de sorte que les scientifiques sont tous des chercheurs-évaluateurs et des chercheurs-évalués. Nous nous prévenons aussi de travailler le concept \"d'autonomie de la science\", qui, sans définition claire pour une organisation sociale, peut provoquer la dissonance de critiques formulées envers la gouvernance de la recherche ([Giry2022](reference/Giry2022.md)). Nous nous proposons d'expliquer le déclin de la théorisation en sciences naturelles dans les pays membres de l'OCDE, d'un point de vue systémique et économique.\n\n## La perte d'historicité des projets de recherche\n\nIl peut arriver que les projets proposés par plusieurs chercheurs soient semblables. L'histoire des sciences regorge de ces courses à la priorité pour une même découverte ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)) et cette remarque sociologique demeure aujourd'hui un postulat des modèles économiques de la science ([Stephan2015](reference/Stephan2015.md)). Ce phénomène est d'autant plus important qu'il est constitutif d'une règle fondamentale du jeu de la science : la pluralité conflictuelle. Le savoir scientifique est fonctionnel en société à condition qu'il ait fait consensus, c'est-à-dire que les conflits ayant existé disparaissent[^1]. La pluralité conflictuelle est aussi émulatrice car l'altérité permet d'affiner les arguments et les positions par l'échange. \n\nL'introduction d'un troisième critère de mérite vient dissiper cette conflictualité, collectivement bénéfique. À un antagonisme (*anta*, face-à-face, *agôn*, lutte) poussant chaque acteur à trouver les arguments scientifiques pour combattre ses adversaires, se substitue une concurrence (*concurrere*, courir vers un même point) entre rivaux qui ont un objectif commun, non épistémique. La nature de la compétition se transformant, les acteurs ont la liberté de ne pas se trouver d'adversaires. La \"workforce\" scientifique a intérêt — au sens économique du terme — à travailler de manière productiviste sur un projet où, seule, elle ne se verra pas ralentir par une remise en question de son autorité. Les chercheurs partitionnent l'espace infini des projets rattachables aux thèmes jugés prioritaires. L'intensification de la concurrence par les réformes néolibérales accélère ce processus de compartimentalisation d'un espace en extension continue. \n\nDans la République de la Science, les projets en cours d'étude sont justifiés en faisant référence à une succession d'interrogations épistémiques se rapportant à une tradition sous-disciplinaire, unique et invariante. Si l'on motive un projet essentiellement en faisant référence aux futurs possibles ([Audetat2015](reference/Audetat2015.md)), un nombre ineffable de projets peuvent être acceptés.\n\nL'introduction des mécanismes de marché finit d'effacer l'historicité des projets entrepris. En effet, un système de marché est anhistorique, épistémologiquement parlant ([Koppl2015](reference/Koppl2015.md)). Une loi d'équilibre global entre offre et demande peut être inférée d'une somme d'optimisations locales : la dynamique des chercheurs est gouvernée différentiellement par des signaux (les projets ou \"missions\" financés) qui servent d'instructions pour des acteurs rationnels. \n\nRaconter l'histoire des sciences, c'est dire les changements de théories, car c'est les variations de l'entendement collectif qui *font date*. Or, le système de marché considère l'étude de problèmes donnés avec des théories considérées intemporelles, et semble ainsi mettre fin à l'histoire des sciences. L'absence de renouvellement théorique renforce la croyance en la complétude de la dernière théorie. Nous assistons donc à l'étude de sujets de plus en plus génériques avec des théories (inévitablement) spécifiques et dogmatiques.\n\n\n##  Le déclin de la synthèse critique des savoirs existants\n\nThéoriser demande d'adopter un regard plus large que la théorie unique et déborde de la surspécialisation sous-disciplinaire selon plusieurs perspectives. D'abord, une réflexivité épistémologique est importante pour comprendre une méthode disciplinaire. Ensuite, connaître une théorie (ou une épistémologie) signifie pouvoir énumérer ses spécificités *par rapport* à d'autres. Aussi, l'histoire d'une tradition scientifique n'est rarement que \"le musée des erreurs de la raison\" où \"l'antériorité chronologique est une infériorité logique\" ([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md), p. 54), de sorte que les raisonnements de géants — selon l'adage de Newton — défrichent des chemins qui nous permettent de trouver des voies véritablement nouvelles. \n\nL'activité théorique est *nécessaire* à la science, car \"les faits suscitent les théories, mais ils n'engendrent pas les concepts qui les unifient intérieurement ni les intentions intellectuelles qu'elles développent\" ([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md), p. 100). Elle consiste à organiser les savoirs en recourant à des analyses et synthèses critiques tout en les englobant dans un discours qui leur donne un sens nouveau. \n\nAinsi, la synthèse critique de faits et de théories existants est centrale en recherche, car elle constitue l'autorité scientifique qui a une double fonction dans la République de la Science et parce qu'elle est essentielle à la théorisation. \n\nNotre argument est le suivant. Si le marché assume partiellement — et d'une quelconque manière — la sélection des projets de recherche, alors le travail que doit fournir un chercheur-évaluateur pour constituer son autorité scientifique n'est plus que partiellement nécessaire. Ce dernier est délivré de la tâche de synthèse critique, qui est, par ailleurs, cruciale à la théorisation. Parallèlement, la chercheuse-évaluée est alors partiellement astreinte aux signaux du marché qui lui indique les projets sur lesquels elle peut travailler via des financements sélectifs. Cette chercheuse n'a plus d'intérêt — au sens économique — à faire une synthèse critique des savoirs existants pour identifier un sujet original ; elle n'entretient donc plus son savoir-faire théorique. \n\nCet assujettissement de la chercheuse-évaluée à un système mécanique auquel les tâches jadis accomplies — par le chercheur-contrôleur — ont été déléguées est une prolétarisation (au sens de Marx). En pratique, la désindividuation causée par cette prolétarisation (au sens de Simondon) se révèle dans le fait qu'un chercheur adopte un sujet qu'il ne peut motiver autrement qu'en invoquant une demande. La \"workforce\" se désintéresserait personnellement de son sujet d'étude, elle le choisirait parce qu'il se présenterait à elle d'une manière ou d'une autre — \"pourquoi ne pas étudier cela ?\". \n\nCes automatisations facilitent individuellement le travail, mais sont collectivement délétères. L'appauvrissement des savoirs par l'automatisation plus générale des savoir-faire est pointé du doigt en biologie ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)). Notons que la circularité de cette organisation, où les chercheurs sont à la fois évaluateurs et évaluées, nous oblige à déduire l'érosion progressive de l'autorité scientifique, clef de voûte de la République de la Science. Nous arrivons cependant ici aux limites du modèle, car c'est peut-être justement la relative non-mixité des évaluateurs et des évalués qui ralentit la trivialisation des savoirs. \n\nRésumons. Théoriser nécessite d'effectuer une synthèse critique des savoirs existants, travail dont l'intérêt économique est garanti pour les chercheurs avant les années soixante. Après l'introduction d'un critère de mérite non épistémique et l'automatisation de son interprétation, cet intérêt disparait, car la sélection des projets financés est partiellement délégué aux mécanismes d'un marché. La synthèse critique n'étant plus essentielle, la théorisation est délaissée.\n\n##  Le déclin de la créativité\n\nLa théorisation demande une certaine créativité pour donner un sens nouveau à des savoirs existants, et l'on peut se demander si les moyens de communication entre scientifiques encouragent cette activité. En effet, la massification des articles au format standardisé privilégie la transmission d'informations à la qualité interprétative d'opinions. Outre l'effet de nombre noyant les recherches les plus originales ([Chu2021](reference/Chu2021.md)), les articles sont de plus en plus courts ([Fire2019](reference/Fire2019.md)) et impersonnels.\n\nCette communication entre chercheurs ressemble à celles décrites dans les théories de l'information. Les articles sont compressés pour maximiser leur quantité d'information (Kolmogorov) de sorte que le lecteur doit décrypter l'article pour en assimiler le contenu. Ce travail qui consiste à poser des explications, des images, des exemples, identifier des concepts généraux se rattachant aux idées, lier à d'autres opinions contradictoires, et effectuer d'autres redondances compressibles n’est donc pas partagé entre scientifiques. Ainsi, il y a comme un gaspillage gigantesque de protensions intellectuelles au nom d'une neutralité qui serait synonyme d'objectivité. Le minimum factuel est énoncé au détriment d'opinions polarisantes, bien que basées sur des faits.\n\nNous retrouvons dans les formes de communication entre chercheurs l'effacement de la pluralité conflictuelle mentionnée plus haut, celle qui engage la réflexion collectivement constructive et générative. L'écriture d'un commentaire d'article n'est pas encouragée ([Trebino2009a](reference/Trebino2009a.md)) et très peu pratiquée. Moins d'un pour cent des citations servent à contredire un article ([Nicholson2021](reference/Nicholson2021.md)). La réflexion théorique préfère pourtant quelques opinions qualitativement formulées et situées à un déluge d'informations dissimulant le rationnel extrêmement spécifique qui choisit de les exhiber. \n\nDe même, la perte d'historicité des projets de recherche s'actualise dans les articles ([Park2023](reference/Park2023.md)), et le travail anti-entropique de théorisation (organisation des savoirs et création d'un nouveau sens) devient plus difficile quand la production d'entropie informationnelle est trop élevée (informations isolées sans liens avec le passé ou entre elles) ([Alombert2021](reference/Alombert2021.md)). \n\nLes modèles économiques de la science considèrent l'originalité d'une chercheuse comme un facteur intrinsèque qui les discrimine — similaire à la vision de l'artiste talentueuse par nature. Cette originalité a pourtant comme source les idées et les imaginaires qui ont la qualité de se partager en se diversifiant et en se multipliant, contrairement à l'information qui subit une loi unilatérale de dégradation lors de sa transmission (Shannon). Au-delà d'une organisation vitalisée par l'orgueil, une économie des théories scientifiques qui conçoit les contagions virales d'imaginaires canalisés par des critères empirico-logiques rigoureux, serait le début d'un modèle d'organisation anti-entropique de la république des savoirs. \n\nRemarquons enfin les similarités d'une république des savoirs et d'une république démocratique — et de leur érosion synchrone. Elles demandent la confrontation d'opinions individuelles sur des sujets dont les intérêts sont partagés, l'acceptation d'une autorité horizontale qu'il faut s'efforcer de comprendre tout en la contestant productivement et pertinemment. C'est le désir partagé d'un progrès — sans direction — qui fait l'histoire et la spécificité de ces républiques. C'est les imaginaires qui vitalisent et conditionnent le la dynamique de ces sociétés auto-instituées ([Castoriadis1975](reference/Castoriadis1975.md)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nL'empirisme computationnel ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)) est productif et il est rassurant de voir les scientifiques travailler dans la période que nous traversons. Cependant, pour sortir de la disruption ([Stiegler2016](reference/Stiegler2016.md)) il nous faut générer des savoirs réellement nouveaux. Cela demande de reconsidérer l'organisation actuelle de la recherche en sciences naturelles, car elle déprécie le travail de synthèse critique des savoirs existants qui est nécessaire à la théorisation. Elle efface aussi la pluralité conflictuelle, émulatrice et génératrice d'idées.\n\nIl est commun d'entendre que nous devons \"changer notre rapport au vivant\", rarement qu'il faut proposer de nouvelles théories en biologie. En 1913, Radl notait qu'un savant qui ne se tient pas devant la nature comme devant des phénomènes étrangers et qui sent son appartenance à celle-ci était un vitaliste  — et non un mécaniste (in [Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md), p. 111). La proximité de débats écologiques contemporains avec l'histoire de la biologie devrait nous inviter à une réflexion épistémologique sur nos pratiques actuelles.

(1945)         \n*The American Economic Review* 35: 519–530       \n\nReference: [Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)\n\n\n#### Hayek's contribution is identifying the mechanism of the market system\nBriefly, we sketch the essence of a market organization. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:\n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003e(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)\n\n#### Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes \nAccording to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 7) \n\nIn practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book *The Road to Serfdom* —, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.\n\n#### Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors\nHow, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 8) \n\nThe more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market _self-regulation_.\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIt is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 10) \n\n\n#### The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)\nThe decentralized plans of _self-interested actors_ — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the _competition_ for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 11) \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- Knowledge cannot be reduced to digits. This echoes the informational metaphor in biology. It tends to consider negatively (as noise) everything that cannot be digitalized, here even reduced to a single number. See [note on Longo2012](note/note%20on%20Longo2012.md).\n- It takes Whitehead remark as a goal. \n- Everyone seems independent and does not rely on others. Individuals cannot influence themselves. No mimetism. \n- The market needs an exogeous cause to change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. In practice, external events perturbing the cost of one commodity do occur all the time so that everything happen _as if_ prices were evolving because commodities were traded.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.779890252Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Henriques2013":{"title":"note on Henriques2013","content":"\n## **Policy-making in science policy: The ‘OECD model’ unveiled**     \nby Henriques L., Larédo P. (2013)         \n*Research Policy* 42: 801-816       \nDOI: 10.1016/j.respol.2012.09.004     \n\nReference: [Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)\n\n#### Science become too important to be left to an invisible hand\nIn the 60's, several reasons bring experts to lean over science and technologies (S\u0026T) policies for the first time. First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer: \n\n\u003e[!quote]\n\u003e\n\u003eIf governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. ([OECD1966](reference/OECD1966.md) , p.8)\n\nThis input/output continuous model being *de facto* extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good. \n\nSecond, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to be on the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two countries threat each other with nuclear weapons. There is a need for being able to plan research activities. \n\nThird, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md),[Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. The market cannot anticipate what is good for societies, and as research should be funded by public funds (this is also called 'market failure'). \n\n#### The OECD led the international transformation of science\nIn this context, and based on those arguments, the OECD changed its role, which so far consisted in sharing good practices and tested policies among its members. It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S\u0026T, led by a group of experts. The model they constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). \n\n#### The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth\nThe OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needs. Some fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate ressources on specific research areas. Accordingly, quantitative indicators must be developed to assess to quality of science and refine policies: this is the birth of the Frascati manual, still in used nowadays.  \n\n#### Comments\n\n- The linear model of science is incompatible with revolutions in science ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)). \n\n- This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions. It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity.

There was the [Groupe des Dix](definition/Groupe%20des%20Dix.md), [complexity sciences](definition/complexity%20sciences.md), but also complexity in informatics (see e.g., [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md)). There is no one area, but several and different ones. \n\n#### Complexity sciences constitute a plateform rather than a discipline\n[complexity sciences](definition/complexity%20sciences.md) are not autonomous. They cannot preserve or reproduce their scientific activity in the traditional sense (no courses, no social existence in universities, no specific allocation or commission at CNRS for instance). However, they share theoretical stances, collaborate and recognize each other with topics (chaos, network, emergence, etc.). Scientists are not specialists of complexity, they rather have a **dual role** and complexity appears on their CV in second or third position. It is, however, more than a mere trend because it lasts throughout time, a community persists. In a nutshell, it is rather a **scientific platform.** \n\n#### Complexity sciences rely on classical ontologies and epistemologies\nStructure of scientific argumentation rely on Ockham's razor, toy modeling, **statistics**, **mathematical modeling**, and proof of concept. [backcasting](definition/backcasting.md) is also often used.

At the end of WW2 (and cryptography played a major role during this period), [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology that explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA.\n\n\n#### The informational metaphor prompts biologits to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.\nIt relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the \"program\" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). This view directly eliminates the radical materiality of living organisms. For instance, Maynard Smith (that tries to explicitate the notion of information in biology without managing to distinguish Turing and Shannon'concepts) states:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThere is, however, one feature of the control of development which closely resembles both a computer program, and verbal instructions. This is the symbolic nature of the process (...) —  ([MaynardSmith1999](reference/MaynardSmith1999.md), p. 398)  \n\n#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...\nProgramming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). \n\n\n#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology\nMoreover, information is not well-defined for the living because it has ambiguous links with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](concept/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by Schrödinger ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)), it seems that organisms manage to \"resist\" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. \n\n#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.\nThe DNA \"software\" taken from one cell (the \"hardware\") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to \"epigenetics reprogramming\" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to \"reprogram\" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as \"signals\", \"activator-receptor\", or \"docking\".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIf a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) \n\n For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cell to cell, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (hemodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial ([Lucitti2007](reference/Lucitti2007.md), [Tang2004](reference/Tang2004.md), [Muller2003](reference/Muller2003.md), [Rot-Nikcevic2007](reference/Rot-Nikcevic2007.md), [Jakkaraju2003](reference/Jakkaraju2003.md)).  \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.779890252Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Montevil2015":{"title":"note on Montévil2015","content":"\n#### **Biological organisation as closure of constraints**     \nby Montévil M., Mossio M.

Therefore, physics cannot use organisms as an object *per se*. In physics, an organisms can only be encountered as result of the interactions between a multitude of invariant objects. However, even cells are created, change, and disappear. Physics must then use sub-cellular elements to describe organisms. While this option is possible in principle, it is far from obvious that it is most practical approach. Pragmatically, physics is still far from being able to understand or model a single cell. Therefore, while being different from physics, an rigorous theoretical frame that uses organisms as objects, could increase objectivity in biology. \n\n### A sound departure from determinism \n\nWe argue that departing from physics means giving up a deterministic view of biological phenomena. The latter is enshrined in physicalist reductionnism (theories of natural sciences are reducible to those of physics), that usually take two aspects. For neopreformationist, it is complete genetic determinism. Life can be written by combinations of four letters, materialized by nucleotides. Therefore, organisms can be enumerated, and they all preexist. For others, living beings can be understood with the deterministic trajectories of atoms because they are made of such particles. Of course, those two claims are seldom endorsed as such by scientists. Rather, they are moderated by mentioning, for instance, epigenetics in the first case, the impredictibility of quantum mechanics or chaos theory in the second. \n\nHowever, in both cases, the limit of this approach does not emerge from the fact that additional effects are ignored (which would make determinism a bad approximation). Rather, it lies in the fact that the chosen observables are not pertinent for the *understanding* of organisms, starting with their viability. A extraordinary small part of those phase spaces are relevant for biology, *as far as we know*. Even if we endorse complete genetic determinism, DNA sequences that program living beings represent an extremely small number of all the ones that can be enumerated. Atomic positions and velocities that can be attribuated to organisms are nearly singularities in the corresponding phase space. Almost all elements of those spaces do not represent an organism (Fig.1a). In physical terms, those spaces are explored by the universe in a strongly non ergodic way ([Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md)).\n\nGiving up these kind of descriptions because of their lack of biological meaning, does not imply ignoring their importance in other theoretical frames (e.g., for DNA sequencing, for physics). However, for biology, they only constitute pre-possibilities ([Montevil2019a](reference/Montevil2019a.md), [note on Montevil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montevil2019a.md)). We need to gather some of the biological meaningful pre-possibilities to constitute a subset a pertinent set of possibilities, *as far as we can tell*. This requires finding those singularities in the original phase space (let's say of positions and velocities), redefining the observables[^1] to reconfigure those possibilities in a meaningful smaller set, and zooming in (Fig.1b, first panel)[^3] . \n\n### Biology is a theoretical sport\n\nPreserving biological meaning by solely considering a relevant set of possibilities comes at a cost. First, adding a possibility in this frameless phase space means having seen it being realized. In other words, the pertinent space of description of organisms is *historical*. Second, adding a new possibility means that the organism has realized this possibility, and that this possibility was not one before that. Therefore, organisms can vary in a fundamentally *unpredictable* way for the theoretical framework. This defines a strong an irreducible notion of randomness in biology (Fig.1b, second panel). Third, because the pertinent observables are established according to the current possibilities, they can also change in time. In sum, the overall mathematical structure that describe an organism change in time (Fig.1b, third panel). \n\nLet's dwell on this last point. Biophysicists always predefine possibilities for the evolution of the functional parts of organisms — for epistemological reasons. The posited phase space proceed from empirical observations, at a given time (Fig.1c, first panel). However, we have seen that the physico-mathematical modelling of organisms — and *a fortiori* one of its pertinent observable — can only be valid for a finite duration. The simulation of a functional part of an organism, sooner or later, will no longer be valid because the organism is not quantitatively *and* qualitatively invariant in time (Fig.1c, second panel).\n\nIn fact, biophysical models often raise an epistemological problem. In fixing values of parameters or initial/boundary conditions to simulate functional parts of an organism, biophysicists seldom justified them with theoretical arguments. This is in contrast with the physical approach, whose objectivity aims to provides general insights about relations between generic objects. It requires discussing a phenomenon for a range of values of parameters to bring epistemic insights ([Montevil2020](reference/Montevil2020.md)). For instance, free fall is the physical insight brought by models showing that an object of *any* mass (negligeable compared to the one of Earth), and initially dropped at *any* altitude, end up on the ground.\n\nHowever, parameters and initial/boundary conditions in biophysical models *are* specific. Yet, they can be understood only in the light of previous models of the organism, that is its history. Moreover, whereas physics relies on a relational epistemology, it does not account for the specific circular organization of the functional parts of an organism that allows it to self-maintain. Therefore, an organicist epistemology requires to resort to the epistemology of history and an epistemology of self-maintaining physical systems. Accordingly, *biological models need to sychronically and diachronically articulate physico-mathematical models of an organism's functional parts* (Fig.1c). \n\n### A definition of specific objects\n\nFrom the above-mentionned considerations, we can posit the *principle of variation* ([Montevil2016](reference/Montevil2016.md)): ==organisms are **specific** objects==.\n\nSpecific objects undergo *unpredictable* variations that make the mathematical framework that describe them change in time. \nSpecific objects cannot be understood without their *history* of variations, that justifies the phase space in which the organism is described. \nSpecific objects are *contextual* objects, like generic objects. Yet, due to their historicity, the *contextual history* of specific object matters[^2].  \n\nSpecific objects exhibit differences when compared to each other, or with themselves at different time. \nSimilarities between two specific objects can only stem from a shared history, more precisely from common descent. \nSpecific objects, unlike generic objects, are difficult to abstract from their material instantiations, mainly for epistemic reasons.\n\nGiven the principle of variation, the relative regularities of the functional parts of an organism remain to be explained.\nWe will argue elsewhere that it needs to be explained thanks to the circularity of their organization. \n\nThis principle is inspired by the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from \"chance\", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. Other roots of the idea come from ([Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md)) and ([Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md)).\nVariation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...\nIn contrast to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). \n\n\n[^1]: It will be argued elsewhere that the pertinent observables for biology are material entities that have a [biological function](concept/biological%20function.md) or that are constrained by them — those term will be defined. In the folllowing, pertinent observables and functional part are synonymous. \n\n[^2]: For instance, the immune repertoire of mammals depends on a contextual history at the ontogenetic and genealogical time scale. \n\n[^3]: Note that this is what is done in when organisms are described by genes that are determistically related to biological functions. However, it has been shown that organisms are not solely determined by their genes, and that this correspondance is rather complex, and context-dependent. Moreover, if the human genome is defined by around 25,000 genes, the argument for non-ergodicity regarding the possible combinations of gene networks is the same.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.779890252Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Montevil2019":{"title":"note on Montevil2019 and Montevil2020a","content":"\n#### **Measurement in biology is methodized by theory**     \nby Montévil M. (2019)         \n*Biology \u0026 Philosophy* 34: 35   \n\nReference: [Montevil2019](reference/Montevil2019.md) \n\n### My introduction and recap of the [note on Montevil2016 and Montevil2020](note/note%20on%20Montevil2016%20and%20Montevil2020.md). \n\nGeneric objects are symmetric with respect to the scientific rationale, and one needs not to specify which electron it uses for an experiment in physics. In other words, electrons all share the same properties that define them. The object of biology, organisms, are specific objects. Therefore, biological knowledge is *a priori* bounded in time if one assumes that the relevance of an epistemic insight is primarily to be assessed by the existence of the studied object.\n\nThe merit of this provocative view is to contrast with the mainstream belief that looks for invariant laws in biology. Indeed, practical measures undertaken to tackle the irreproducibility crisis in biomedical research ([Bustin2014](reference/Bustin2014.md),[Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md)) are rather protocolization ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)), making raw data available, or even video-taping scientists ([Clark2017](reference/Clark2017.md)), rather then questionning theoretical frames ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)).\n\nA proper philosophical inquiry about the nature of biological knowledge seems crucial once organisms are acknowledged as specific objects. Can we obtain general insights of biological phenomena? Is studing extinct organisms relevant *per se* or does it need to aim to understanding the history of the present ones? Does biological knowledge is less certain, by construction, than the one of physics? What does biology aims to understands if organisms are continuously changing their laws? Are there regularities in the ways variations are unpredictably occuring ? Does those regularities have a lifetime?\n\nIn any case, there is no doubt that practical research in biology must be able to generalize scientific results. Therefore, in practice, measurements need to go beyond the principled specificity of organisms, and argue for practical categories. This amount to descibing a \"method\" section in experimental papers.\n\n### What do biologists do? \n\nNames in biology come from systematics. It articulates taxonomy (or typification — selection of an object to represent the group type) and phylogenetic. Names are associated with concrete material objects. They define the offsprings of this specific object. They are insufficient for scientific practices because we do not know the amount of variations that the specie or its descent experienced since the naming. Even inbred strains vary due to genetic drift. To limit variations, lab exchange strains and therefore matter. \n\n\n![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230403194022.png)\n\nControl of the past context is also done on ontological time scales. Stress, place of development, etc. But, past context does not only refer to development. Being infected by a virus is a past context, that plays a role in the experience. Biologist often filter individuals that have undergone unwanted variations, are frightened, with mutations, etc. When measuring, you can have the \"there is no case for that\" problem. This is also the Glaton's board effect, with qualitative diffference.\n\n### What is a [biological measurement](concept/biological%20measurement.md)?\n\n\n### Introducing the concept of [symmetrization](concept/symmetrization.md)\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis gives you practical strategies to measure individuals in practice. Here, you control \"whole\" organisms, material objects that are exchanged or named. However, you do not know how much they have varied since your last naming, controle, etc. Therefore, you did not define an organism identity, rather what happens in practice.

(2019)         \n*Synthese* 196: 4555-4581       \n\nReference: [Montevil2019a](reference/Montevil2019a.md) \n\n\n### Introduction\n\nNovelty is used to classify organisms (phylogenetic trees minimize their number to understand ancestors), but they are not properly defined in biology. In maths, everything is given by the hypothesis, all can be deduced from that ? In physics, it is not that straightforward and there is a very weak form of novelty, but it is very different from the biological one.\n\nThe paper aims at defining a [novelty](concept/novelty.md) and the concept of [new possibility](concept/new%20possibility.md). \n\nA novelty is related to a diachronic emergence, in contrast to (synchronic) emergence which is used in physics in complex systems. However, there are diachronic emergence in physics when \"new\" macroscopic forms emerge (e.g. crystallization). \n\nThis papers wants to provide a better definition of novelties than the one of changing phase space. \n\n### Bergson's paradox \n\nWe can mathematically define all sheet scores of music. Does it mean all symphonies have been composed yet ? In other words,\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eCan we define the possibility of a symphony without composing it? —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 5) \n\n### Generic and specific definitions\n\nThree kinds of sets in mathematics: \n\n$\\mathbb{R}$-like: The set is defined, but only a finite number can be defined specifically. Indeed, the probability of having a name for a real number taken randomly is zero. Mathematics or physics can reason on generic variables (e.g. $x^2 \\geq 0$). They don't need to define specifically all real numbers to do so.\n\n$\\mathbb{N}$-like: The set is defined, and all elements can be defined specifically. However, the set is infinite and therefore it requires generic reasoning (such as a recurrence relation that \"propagates\"). \n\nfinite set : The set is defined, and we can reason on each element individually. \n\nSymphonies are finite combinations of finite set of notes, so they are in the $\\mathbb{N}$-like category. \n\n#### Physics restrict the discussion about generic properties of things \n\nPhysics matters about generic **relations** between quantities: it is not about the quantities.\n\nIt uses generic initial/boundary conditions or parameters and discuss about them generically (basin of attraction, ranges of parameters, etc.)\n\nDefining a domain of probability means setting all others to 0. Saying that all other situation have probability zero means have a generic reasoning. \n\nIn statistical mechanics, we don't care about a specific configuration where all particles form a ring. Rather, we coarse grain a phase space to generically define a macrostate. \n\nWhen bifurcations occur, physics aims at making them generic (period doubling). When they are singular, they do not convey a physical meaning.\n\nIn chaotic systems, everything is actually contained in the initial condition. For a fixed dynamical law, it just dig deeper and deeper into it. Nothing is new.\n\n\n#### Do symphonies share some *relevant* properties ?\n\nWhat makes symphonies what they are (*relevant* properties), is it a shared property?  \nCan we have a generic definition in the set of all music scores for symphonies?\nSymphonies share properties, but it is not the properties that makes them what they are.\n\nIn machine learning, one can find some relevant properties for some symphonies that have the same composer for instance. But the symphonies pre-exist, their generic properties are not pre-stated. The generic sets (patterns) that are identified are specific to the composer. Novelties are new points near the law that is trying to be approached, and may not be interesting from a musical point of view.\n\n\n#### The concept of [novelty](concept/novelty.md) is introduced \n\nDNA and phenotypes are another example. No explicit relations. Gene expression is contextual. DNA cannot discuss the viability of phenotypes. Two different theoretical levels. Even with the idea of a complete genetic determinism (postulated without the generic causal rule — the algorithm) one needs to consider new possibilities. Models of networks, chemical sets do not define possibilities either. \n\n#### The argument of all-encompassing sets are refutated\n\nDynamical system of atoms for the organism with determinism. Then novelties are to be found in the specific initial conditions. But they do not define explicit biological possibility. \n\nAll-encompassing sets are also compatible with the notion of novelty. \n\n#### Weak novelty in physics\n\nIt comes from symmetry breaking. Cooled down Ising spins choose a random direction to orient. Novelty ? \n\n- The novelty is a choice, you can prestate the possibilities (angle)\n- It can be repeated *ad libidum*\n- The novelty has to appear at a given threshold\n- It is ponctual so transition phase are elementary (binary)\n- Equation at the microscopic level does not change \n- Macroscopic possibilities are finite, small in number, they can be predicted after investigation\n- Anhistorical system, so that novelties does not impact the future dynamic \n\nActual possibilities can be understood by the relations between the parts before the possibility is actualized. \nVirtual possibilities do not follow the causal relations requires to understand the initial sitution. \n\n#### The concept of [new possibility](concept/new%20possibility.md) in biology is nedeed\n\nIt is argued that specificity + functionality leads to historicity and therefore the idea of new possibility.\nA biological function is specific because it belongs to an organization.\nTherefore, it needs the concept of new possibility. \n\n\n#### Response to maths objections\n\nBeing able to generate a pattern is not being able to explain it, that is to be an explicit possibility. \nIt is choosing a good initial condition. \nBe careful with the retrospective illusion : saying that something was a possibility because it happened.\nNo, it was not at that time.

(2021)         \n\n**Abstract**:  What do mainstream scientists acknowledge as original scientific contributions? In other words, what is the current épistémè in natural sciences? This essay attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical, generating data and computational, to analyze them and reproduce them with models. This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.\n\nReference: [Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)\n\n\n### Summary\n\n\n#### The IMRaD structure is about contextualizing a single unbiased observation to transform it to knowledge.\nIt is like adding a single brick on the cathedral of knowledge. The separation of results and discussion means that your mind is a virgin receptacle for information to flow inside. Then, you analyze the results that you have unbiasly seen. With the IMRaD format, scientists exchange information without being transformed (receptor, receiver). This is not theoretial thinking since the latter change how we think about phenomena. In fact, scientists do not have time to engage with specific ways to organize scientific rationality.\n\n#### Experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world, that is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from an interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon\n\nThere is a confusion between objectivity and automation. You can make something automatic with a deep unoticed theoretical commitment. \n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eprotocolization can also be counterproductive since it downplays the work of objectivation, that is to say, the articulation between procedures and theoretical thinking. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 5) \n\n\n#### The current épistémè still has a positivist influence\nThe scientific aim in the current épistémè is to find causal patterns or \"mechanisms\". Case studies or not considered, but they can give useful insights: the existence of one planet, the fact that something is possible, etc. The kind of knowledge that is looked for points to [scientific positivism](concept/scientific%20positivism.md). The épistémè builds on induction and is a kind of empiricism.\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ecomputational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations. It cares for numerical questions (like statistics); however, it does not attend its logoi significantly, by analytical means or otherwise. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n#### Review articles contrast with original research in the current épistémè, except when statistical meta-analysis are performed\nAs review articles are typically required to be critical, the computational statistical analysis seems to considered more original then subjective critics. Review articles are requested by editors, which are often not researchers. With the massification and acceleration of scientific production, synthetic works should be valuable. They are not. However, theorization has a synthetic function.\n\n#### Modelling is specific to a phenomena, is not theoretical work and need to be included in a theoretical framework\nHowever, like in Planck's quanta case, it can be the starting point for a broader general framework. Most models are mathematical (and computational). They aim to imitate several properties with precision. Theoretical work confers a profound scientific meaning to the properties of models (Planck's quanta). Mathematical modelling is not theoretical work when it is local. When it results from a theoretical move, with original mathematical tools, it is then a part of theoritization. For instance, mathematical tools that originate from physics and transferred to biology convey implicit considerations. Models need to be included in a theoretical framework.\n\n#### Computational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations\nIt cares for numerical questions but do not attend for its logoi. Original works are empirical, generating data to analyze and reproducing them with models. In empirical works, the approach is inductive although statistical Popperian tests are usually conducted. In computational models, the ability to fit empirical data prevail on theoretical consistency or significance.\n\n\n#### The épistémè has some links with the organization of science\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eComputational empiricism is an industrialization of research activity, a paradoxical notion considering that research is about bringing new, singular insights. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThis organization goes with a cumulative view of science, where productivism is a natural aim. —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n#### Computational empiricism produces a state of theory disruption\nMontévil name the current épistémè _computational empiricism_. Most scientists adopt an _inductive_ approach: they generate data, analyze them and/or try to reproduce them using specific models. The analysis are predominantly statistical tests and mathematical models primarly aim at imitation. They are carried out on computers and the theoretical meaning they bear is usually not discussed. Two observations point to a _cumulative_ view of knowledge. First, the standardization of the publication structure, which contextualize a single unbiased observation to communicate an easy-to-find information to other scientists. Second, synthetic works taking place in critical and editor-ordered review articles are explicitely not considered to be original contributions unless they undertake computational meta-analysis. Finally, in the spirit of Bernard Stielger, the author diagnozed a phenomena he calls _theory disruption_, defined as follow:\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn a somewhat perverse way, it also promotes empirical results that destabilize former theoretical frameworks because they catch attention. However, it does not promote rethinking these frameworks, leading to what may be called a theory disruption that is more or less advanced depending on the fields —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9) \n\n\n### Comments\nSee also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) — Chapter Theorie and methods.

International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs. The linear model is modified to include \"tacit knowledge\" (another idea of Polanyi): for a good transfer of knowledge, industries and universities should co-create and collaborate.

Public money, citizens. Who decides? Stakeholders, that is citizens and the private sector — the state should not interfere, only to be \"vigilant\".  This is the market of ideas. Offer and demand. Consumers are citizens and the private sector. However, the money comes citizens. The private sector does not invest whatsoever in this mechanism. They only ask which directions to pursue annd use the fruit of research. \n\nWe go back to a market system, but this is not at the scale of Polanyi. Scientists are sellers that respond to the demand of public/industrials.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n- Do citizens really decide? \n\nThe role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented.  It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal. \n\n- Can stakeholders know what is good for them ? \n\nThe market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want. However, there is no problem, \"should be monitored vigilantly by governments\".  It does not, it is incompatible [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). \n\nIn any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV?

(1962)         \n*Minerva* 1: 54-73       \nDOI: 10.1007/BF01101453     \n\nReference: [Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)\n\n\n#### Background\n\nMicheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of *tacit knowledge* will be used by the OECD later. \n\nIn the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. \n\n##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. \nPolanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1].\n\nWhile Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).\n\n##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards\nHowever, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:\n\n1. Plausibility\n2. Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.\n3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists\n\n##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves\nThe overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. \n\n##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science\nMoreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too. \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  \n\n\n#### Comments\n\n- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.\n- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.\n- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2]. \n\n\u003e[!warning]\n\u003e \n\u003eNeoliberalism was not the dominant ideology in the Western world at that time. The Republic of Science is more related to a liberal view of science, in the classical view, without state intervention. Sixty years later, we find an era of neoliberalism in science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)), but this has nothing to do with what is suggested here. \n\n- Idea of enablement. \n\n[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.\n[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.779890252Z","tags":null},"/note/note-on-Rovelli2017":{"title":"note on Rovelli2017","content":"\n#### **Is time’s arrow perspectival?**     \nby Rovelli C.

Then I “went up” (we say _monter_ à Paris in the south of France) at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) de Paris, in the Chemistry Department. In parallel of these three rich years, I pursued a Master degree analytical, physical and theoretical Chemistry (CAPT) at Sorbonne Université, which is a member of Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL).\n\nAt the end of my first year at the ENS, I no longer had doubts regarding what I wanted to do for a living: research! In this interdisciplinary school, I would take extra biology or anthropology courses. I specialized in theoretical chemistry and worked a lot with members of the PASTEUR group (UMR 8640). Conducting chemistry simulations on classical hardwares made me want to understand the promises of quantum computing for Chemistry. I went six months in IBM Zurich, in the group of Ivano Tavernelli. The internship went so well that we continued working together for one more year. At the end of the day, my first articles, patents, and excellent research memories. Back in Paris, I've worked on an in silico drug discovery code with Maximilien Levesque, who is now CEO and co-founder of AQEMIA. Then, I was contracted by the CNRS for a PhD thesis under the direction of Marie-Laure and Lydéric Bocquet to work on nanofluidics topics. I defended my PhD thesis at the ENS in September 2022: “New approach for electrostatic interactions at metal/liquid interfaces and applications for the graphene/water couple.”\n\nFor more than a year, I've been preparing another project. It started with some readings, such as _La méthode_ of Edgar Morin, which encouraged me to know more about complex systems physics, philosophy of science, and most importantly the organicist tradition in biology (I. Kant, C. Bernard, W.B. Cannon, L. von Bertalanffy, E. Schrödinger, N. Wiener, W.R. Ashby, C.H. Waddington, J. Piaget, H. Maturana, F. Varela, R. Rosen, S. Kauffman). From those readings, I realized that concepts from this tradition were desperately needed to face today's biosphere crisis. However, those ideas crossed centuries without being established in universities, because they lacked the empirico-logical rigor of a scientific theory.\n\nLooking for current representatives of this tradition throughout the universities of several countries, I came across an interdisciplinary group... at the ENS (G. Longo, M. Mossio, M. Montévil, and the other members of the Blaise Pascal Chair of Ana Soto)! They had understood the need for a rigorous epistemological and theoretical work for those ideas to come to fruition. It allowed them, for instance, to answer Schrödinger's question: “How do organisms resist the second law of thermodynamics?”. They were also convinced that those notions were crucial to understand the Anthropocene: they brought new conceptual tools to the philosopher Bernard Stielger. I had found the ecosystem I was looking for.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.779890252Z","tags":null},"/reference/Alombert2021":{"title":"Alombert2021","content":"\n#### **Vocabulaire de l’Internation: Introduction aux concepts de Bernard Stiegler et du collectif Internation**     \nby Alombert A., Krzykawski M.

We find that publications by company scientists have declined over time in a range of industries. We also find that the value attributable to scientific research has dropped, whereas the value attributable to technical knowledge (as measured by patents) has remained stable. These trends are unlikely to be driven principally by changes in publication practices. Furthermore, science continues to be useful as an input into innovation. Our evidence points to a reduction of the private benefits of internal research. Large firms still value the golden eggs of science (as reflected in patents), but seem to be increasingly unwilling to invest in the golden goose itself (the internal scientific capabilities). Managerial summary: There is a widespread belief among commentators that large American corporations are withdrawing from research. Large corporations may still collaborate with universities and acquire promising science-based start-ups, but their labs increasingly focus on developing existing knowledge and commercializing it, rather than creating new knowledge. In this article, we combine firm-level financial information with a large and comprehensive data set on firm publications, patents and acquisitions to quantify the withdrawal from science by large American corporations between 1980 and 2006. This withdrawal is associated with a decline in the private value of research activities, even though scientific knowledge itself remains important for corporate invention. We discuss the managerial and policy implications of our findings.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Arrow1962":{"title":"Arrow1962","content":"\n#### **Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Invention**     \nby Arrow K.

To this purpose, we introduce two principles, in addition to the thermodynamic ones, which are (mathematically) compatible with traditional principles but which have no meaning with regard to inert matter. A traditional balance equation for the metabolism will then be extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We examine far from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of global entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A close analysis of anti-entropy will be performed from the perspective of a diffusion equation of biomass over \"complexity\" and, as a complementary approach and as a tool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schrödinger's method regarding his equation in the field of Quantum Mechanics. We borrow only the operatorial approach from this equation and do so using a classical framework, since we use real coefficients instead of complex ones, thus outside of the mathematical framework of quantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple mathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over complexity as it applies to evolution. We then present, based on the existence of different time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy and anti-entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze the metabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant coefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which fit empirical data. Finally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed, also in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Bailly2011":{"title":"Bailly2011","content":"\n#### **Mathematics and the natural sciences: the physical singularity of life**     \nby Bailly F., Longo G.

In particular, feedback loops focus on the maintenance of the plasma concentrations of glucose within a narrow range. Here, we put forward a different, organicist perspective on the endocrine regulation of glycaemia, by relying on the pivotal concept of closure of constraints. From this perspective, biological systems are understood as organized ones, which means that they are constituted of a set of mutually dependent functional structures acting as constraints, whose maintenance depends on their reciprocal interactions. Closure refers specifically to the mutual dependence among functional constraints in an organism. We show that, when compared to feedback loops, organizational closure can generate much richer descriptions of the processes and constraints at play in the metabolism and regulation of glycaemia, by making explicit the different hierarchical orders involved. We expect that the proposed theoretical framework will open the way to the construction of original mathematical models, which would provide a better understanding of endocrine regulation from an organicist perspective.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Blok2015":{"title":"Blok2015","content":"\n#### **Stakeholder engagement for responsible innovation in the private sector: Critical issues and management practices**     \nby Blok V., Hoffmans L., Wubben E.F.

As a first step, we raise several questions with regard to the possibility of ‘responsible’ innovation and point at several difficulties which undermine the supposedly responsible character of innovation processes, based on an analysis of the input, throughput and output of innovation processes. It becomes clear that the practical applicability of the concept of responsible innovation is highly problematic and that a more thorough inquiry of the concept is required. As a second step, we analyze the concept of innovation which is self-evidently presupposed in current literature on responsible innovation. It becomes clear that innovation is self-evidently seen as (1) technological innovation, (2) is primarily perceived from an economic perspective, (3) is inherently good and (4) presupposes a symmetry between moral agents and moral addressees. By challenging this narrow and uncritical concept of innovation, we contribute to a second round of theorizing about the concept and provide a research agenda for future research in order to enhance a less naïve concept of responsible innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Boolos2007":{"title":"Boolos2007","content":"\n#### **Computability and Logic**     \nby Boolos G.S., Burgess J.P., Jeffrey R.C.

In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of frontier scientific research projects. We argue that the “intellectual distance” between the knowledge embodied in research proposals and an evaluator’s own expertise systematically relates to the evaluations given. To estimate relationships, we designed and executed a grant proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized the assignment of evaluators and proposals to generate 2,130 evaluator–proposal pairs. We find that evaluators systematically give lower scores to research proposals that are closer to their own areas of expertise and to those that are highly novel. The patterns are consistent with biases associated with boundedly rational evaluation of new ideas. The patterns are inconsistent with intellectual distance simply contributing “noise” or being associated with private interests of evaluators. We discuss implications for policy, managerial intervention, and allocation of resources in the ongoing accumulation of scientific knowledge.\n            This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Brillouin1951":{"title":"Brillouin1951","content":"\n#### **Maxwell's Demon Cannot Operate: Information and Entropy.

Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion. These findings suggest fundamental progress may be stymied if quantitative growth of scientific endeavors—in number of scientists, institutes, and papers—is not balanced by structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas.\n          , \n            In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Clark2017":{"title":"Clark2017","content":"\n#### **Science, lies and video-taped experiments**     \nby Clark T.D.

(2002)         \nHarvard University Press      \n\n**Abstract**:  The oracle at Delphi posed a question concerning a boat: If, in time, every plank has rotted and been replaced, is the boat the same boat? Yes, the owner will say, the vessel is not its planks but the relationship between them. Similarly, Antoine Danchin argues in this provocative book, life itself is not revealed just by its components--DNA, ribosomes, genes, cells--but also by their relationships. By the end of 2001, almost 500 genome programs were completed or under way. Drawing upon what researchers worldwide are learning from the gene sequences of bacteria, plants, fungi, fruit flies, worms, and humans, Danchin shows us how genomes are far more than mere collections of genes. They are the means of transmitting the system of relationships making up a living cell from one generation to the next. Genomes are codes that govern the construction, operation, and survival of cells. The Delphic Boat shows us that life is both a complicated piece of chemical machinery that decodes genomes and a process that builds this machinery. The laws of physics or chemistry can only predict so much of this process. To truly understand life, we must understand spatial and temporal relationships between molecules that make up the cell, and how these molecules are coordinated. Danchin persuades us that if we can reach this level of understanding of genomes, we will be able to resolve the major biological puzzle of the twenty-first century: the enigma of the living machine that creates the living machine.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Darwin1859":{"title":"Darwin1859","content":"\n#### **On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life**     \nby Darwin C.

This has been demonstrated by comparing common regulatory sequences among species and by identifying single regulatory mutations that are associated with new phenotypes. However, while a single mutation changes a single element, gene regulation is accomplished by a regulatory network involving multiple interactive elements. Therefore, to better understand regulatory evolution, we have studied how mutations contributed to the adaptation of cells to a regulatory challenge. We created a synthetic genome rewiring in yeast cells, challenged their gene regulation, and studied their adaptation. HIS3, an essential enzyme for histidine biosynthesis, was placed exclusively under a GAL promoter, which is induced by galactose and strongly repressed in glucose. Such rewired cells were faced with significant regulatory challenges in a repressive glucose medium. We identified several independent mutations in elements of the GAL system associated with the rapid adaptation of cells, such as the repressor GAL80 and the binding sites of the activator GAL4. Consistent with the extraordinarily high rate of cell adaptation, new regulation emerged during adaptation via multiple trajectories, including those involving mutations in elements of the GAL system. The new regulation of HIS3 tuned its expression according to histidine requirements with or without these significant mutations, indicating that additional factors participated in this regulation and that the regulatory network could reorganize in multiple ways to accommodate different mutations. This study, therefore, stresses network plasticity as an important property for regulatory adaptation and evolution.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Davies2006":{"title":"Davies2006","content":"\n#### **The Rise and Fall of the Neo-liberal University**     \nby Davies B., Gottsche M., Bansel P.

His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life.In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.This 30th anniversary edition of Dawkins' fascinating book retains all original material, including the two enlightening chapters added in the second edition. In a new Introduction the author presents his thoughts thirty years after the publication of his first and most famous book, while the inclusion of the two-page original Foreword by brilliant American scientist Robert Trivers shows the enthusiastic reaction of the scientific community at that time. This edition is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary thought, a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights, and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today.Review\"Dawkins first book, The Selfish Gene, was a smash hit...Best of all, Dawkins laid out this biology-some of it truly subtle-in stunningly lucid prose.

Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Elzinga1985":{"title":"Elzinga1985","content":"\n#### **Research, bureaucracy and the drift of epistemic criteria**     \nby Elzinga A.

It is argued that the broadening of the Kuhnian concept of the paradigm, making it amenable to science policy studies, was an important move. Further development of this notion, however, standed on the prongs of critique coming from both the worlds of politics and science. At the same time, advances in the cognitive sociology of science undermined the internalist/externalist distinction. Today, with certain changes in the conditions of research due to the introduction of the concept of ?strategic research?, politicians are more apt to accept certain points of the thesis; scientific communities, on the other hand, perceive new threats to their autonomy. This paper tries to make sense of this new situation by translating the question of interplay between internal and external dynamics of research into one involving boundary management and epistemic criteria. The notion of ?epistemic drift? is introduced and the internalist/externalist distinction refurbished in neo-institutionalist terms, making use of the concept of interfoliating credibility cycles.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Estrada2013":{"title":"Estrada2013","content":"\n#### **Graph and Network Theory in Physics.

However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart’s Law, according to which, “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Results In this study, we analyzed \u003e120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal’s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of \u003e2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Fischer2009":{"title":"Fischer2009","content":"\n#### **Michael Polanyi's Republic of Science: The Tacit Dimension**     \nby Fischer F., Mandell A.

Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay, ‘The Republic of Science’. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the tacit dimension in knowledge formation—or what he described as ‘personal knowledge’. On the one hand, his political essay supports a classical conservative position, while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's own ‘fiduciary community’—in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Society—shaped his theoretical conceptualization of the so-called ‘republic of science’. In this way, Polanyi's political contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political thought.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Fodor1974":{"title":"Fodor1974","content":"\n#### **Special Sciences (Or: The Disunity of Science as a Working Hypothesis)**     \nby Fodor J.F.

(2015)         \n\n**Abstract**:  Le vivant critique et chaotique fut le titre de l’école de printemps 2014 de la Société francophone de biologie théorique (SFBT) qui a eu pour motivation d’attirer plus particulièrement la communauté des physiciens, avec pour argumentaire de « transposer les outils d’analyse des systèmes dynamiques hors équilibre, transitoires, critiques et chaotiques utilisés pour décrire la matière inerte au contexte du vivant ». Dans le présent ouvrage, l’objectif a été d’aller au-delà des analyses de stabilité classiques des systèmes de réaction-diffusion pour analyser de façon plus approfondie la dynamique du vivant qui, loin d’être un monde calme et organisé, est en réalité un monde bouleversé avec des régimes le plus souvent métastables ou critiques, voire chaotiques. Ces phénomènes de transition et de bifurcation sont très étudiés en physique et mathématiques et il apparaît opportun de les appliquer à l’analyse des systèmes dynamiques du vivant pour en révéler et en explorer toute la complexité qui reste le plus souvent ignorée. Ce thème du vivant critique et chaotique, laissé à la libre interprétation des auteurs, a été abordé de façons très diverses allant de l’épistémologie à l’aide au diagnostic. Les neuf chapitres qui composent ce livre recouvrent ainsi plusieurs champs disciplinaires incluant les mathématiques, la physique, l’informatique, la biologie, la physiologie et la médecine et de nombreuses applications qui concernent entre autres l’épidémiologie, l’électro- et la neurophysiologie, la signalisation et l’agrégation cellulaire et le système immunitaire. Tous les chapitres proposent des approches ou des points de vue originaux qui se démarquent de ceux généralement admis. Ils contribuent à montrer l’effervescence intellectuelle qui continue d’agiter la biologie théorique et qui en fait un champ de recherche particulièrement stimulant. Le vivant critique et chaotique s’adresse à toute personne qui s’intéresse à la science en général, à l’évolution des sciences et de la biologie théorique en particulier.\n\nIntroduction.

Research is discussed, if at all, as part of the rhetoric on technological innovation. In many respects, research has disappeared as an autonomous object. This chapter documents a key moment in history, in that it was an occurrence responsible for the marginalization of research in scholarly and public discourses. Beginning in the 1960s, a diversity of scholars and practitioners began to question the role of research in contributing to socio-economic progress. They did so by choosing innovation as a key concept. Innovation in this view is a social or holistic process that includes far more than research. In this chapter, I give social existence to a discourse of the 1960s and 1970s, now forgotten but emblematic in the intervening decades, that marginalized research as a perceived source of socio-economic progress.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Godin2020":{"title":"Godin2020","content":"\n#### **The idea of technological innovation: A brief alternative history**     \nby Godin B.

Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Harribey2007a":{"title":"Harribey2007a","content":"\n#### **Les théories de la décroissance: enjeux et limites**     \nby Harribey J.

(2020)         \n\n**Abstract**:  This paper investigates how competition to publish ﬁrst and thereby establish priority impacts the quality of scientiﬁc research. We begin by developing a model where scientists decide whether and how long to work on a given project. When deciding how long to let their projects mature, scientists trade oﬀ the marginal beneﬁt of higher quality research against the marginal risk of being pre-empted. The most important (highest potential) projects are the most competitive because they induce the most entry. Therefore, the model predicts these projects are also the most rushed and lowest quality. We test the predictions of this model in the ﬁeld of structural biology using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for structures of large macromolecules. An important feature of the PDB is that it assigns objective measures of scientiﬁc quality to each structure. As suggested by the model, we ﬁnd that structures with higher ex-ante potential generate more competition, are completed faster, and are lower quality. Consistent with the model, and with a causal interpretation of our empirical results, these relationships are mitigated when we focus on structures deposited by scientists who – by nature of their employment position – are less focused on publication and priority.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Holton1975":{"title":"Holton1975","content":"\n#### **On the Role of Themata in Scientific Thought**     \nby Holton G.

The aim of the present article is to analyze the epistemological status attributed in the science of complexity to several fundamental ideas, such as those of scientific law, objectivity, and prediction. The aim is to show that the hope of superseding reductionism by means of concepts such as that of “emergence” is fallacious and that the science of complexity proposes forms of reductionism that are even more restrictive than the classical ones, particularly when it claims to unify in a single treatment problems that vary widely in nature such as physical, biological, and social problems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Jakkaraju2003":{"title":"Jakkaraju2003","content":"\n#### **Role of stretch in activation of smooth muscle cell lineage**     \nby Jakkaraju S., Zhe X., Schuger L.

It has been assumed that models give us knowledge because they represent their supposed real target systems. However, here agreement among philosophers of science has tended to end as they have presented widely different views on how representation should be understood. I will argue that the traditional representational approach is too limiting as regards the epistemic value of modelling given the focus on the relationship between a single model and its supposed target system, and the neglect of the actual representational means with which scientists construct models. I therefore suggest an alternative account of models as epistemic tools. This amounts to regarding them as concrete artefacts that are built by specific representational means and are constrained by their design in such a way that they facilitate the study of certain scientific questions, and learning from them by means of construction and manipulation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Koppl2015":{"title":"Koppl2015","content":"\n#### **Economics for a creative world**     \nby Koppl R., Kauffman S., Felin T., Longo G.

Because economic dynamics are creative, the implicit frame of analysis for the econosphere changes in unprestatable and non-algorithmic ways. New-venture, social, and political entrepreneurs solve the frame problem of the econosphere. Economic evolution is unpredictable, not entailed, and the number of things traded (‘cambiodiversity’) increases over time. Our metatheoretic framework points out how institutions, entrepreneurs, and disparate actors enable what we call ‘novelty intermediation’. We provide examples of novelty intermediation from Rennaissance Italy to Silicon Valley. Our framework does not automatically provide clear policy prescriptions in part because our main result is negative. It may nevertheless provide a useful prolegomenon to a future economics ﬁt for a creative world.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Krenn2022":{"title":"Krenn2022","content":"\n#### **On scientific understanding with artificial intelligence**     \nby Krenn M., Pollice R., Guo S.Y., Aldeghi M., Cervera-Lierta A., Friederich P., dos Passos Gomes G., Häse F., Jinich A., Nigam A., Yao Z., Aspuru-Guzik A.

Trying to answer this question, we adopted a definition of ‘scientific understanding’ from the philosophy of science that enabled us to overview the scattered literature on the topic and, combined with dozens of anecdotes from scientists, map out three dimensions of computer-assisted scientific understanding. For each dimension, we review the existing state of the art and discuss future developments.

Second, a reduction in fraud verification costs may not lead to a reduction of misconduct episodes but rather to a change in the type of research that is performed. Third, a strong “publish or perish” pressure may reduce, and not increase, scientific misconduct because it motivates more scrutiny.

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe Modern Synthesis (MS) emerged in the first half of the twentieth century, with the integration of Darwinian natural selection, population-level thinking and Mendelian inheritance —  (Laland et al., 2015, p. 1) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003etoday’s evolutionary theory is vastly more sophisticated than the original synthesis and covers a broader range of phenomena.

Natural history and evolution biology of the twentieth century have not completely removed idealism, where the dynamics of life are not fully understood because they are locked up into invariants, as if these latter would exist in the material world. Biology needed a principle of change to explain the evolution of species, but a principle of stability to explain the regularity in the structure and function of the body and its organs. The grade is a classification structure that designates a “degree of complexity”, and that, taken in an evolutionist context, proclaims the degree of complexity. The notion of a body plan is used in articles on developmental genetics.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Levecque2017":{"title":"Levecque2017","content":"\n#### **Work organization and mental health problems in PhD students**     \nby Levecque K., Anseel F., De Beuckelaer A., Van der Heyden J., Gisle L.

The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/LiVigni2021":{"title":"LiVigni2021","content":"\n#### **Histoire et sociologie des sciences de la complexité**     \nby Li Vigni F.

The elaboration of theoretical principles is examined in the light of the rich interactions between physics and mathematics. These two disciplines share common principles of construction of concepts and of the proper objects of inquiry. Theory construction in physics relies on mathematical symmetries that preserve the key invariants observed and proposed by such theory; these invariants buttress the idea that the objects of physics are generic and thus interchangeable and they move along specific trajectories which are uniquely determined, in classical and relativistic physics., In contrast to physics, biology is a historical science that centers on the changes that organisms experience while undergoing ontogenesis and phylogenesis. Biological objects, namely organisms, are not generic but specific; they are individuals. The incessant changes they undergo represent the breaking of symmetries, and thus the opposite of symmetry conservation, a central component of physical theories. This instability corresponds to the changes of the environment and the phenotypes., Inspired by Galileo’s principle of inertia, the “default state” of inert matter, we propose a “default state” for biological dynamics following Darwin’s first principle, “descent with modification” that we transform into “proliferation with variation and motility” as a property that spans life, including cells in an organism. These dissimilarities between theories of the inert and of biology also apply to causality: biological causality is to be understood in relation to the distinctive role that constraints assume in this discipline. Consequently, the notion of cause will be reframed in a context where constraints to activity are seen as the core component of biological analyses. Finally, we assert that the radical materiality of life rules out distinctions such as “software vs. hardware.”\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Longo2021":{"title":"Longo2021","content":"\n#### **Programming Evolution: A Crack in Science**     \nby Longo G.

Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a-/-). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood. These data show that hemodynamic force is necessary and sufficient to induce vessel remodeling in the mammalian yolk sac.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Marx2005":{"title":"Marx2005","content":"\n#### **Grundrisse: Foundations of the critique of political economy**     \nby Marx K.

Ideally, useful information expands alternatives, clariﬁes choice and enables policy makers to achieve desired outcomes. Decision makers, however, often lack the useful information needed for good decision-making. By concentrating efforts on increasing the supply of scientiﬁc information, scientists may not be producing information considered relevant and useful by decision makers, and may simply be producing too much of the wrong kind of information. Users may have speciﬁc information needs that go unmet, or may not be aware of the existence of potentially useful information. This paper deﬁnes the practical problem of reconciling the supply of scientiﬁc information with users’ demands so that scientists produce information that decision makers need and use in policy decisions. Literature from a variety of disciplines and topics is reviewed to: explain the goals of reconciling the supply and demand of scientiﬁc information; deﬁne what constitutes useful information; explore lessons learned from experience and describe the characteristics and conditioning factors that shaped those experiences; and identify various alternative strategies and processes that forge stronger science policy linkages. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.78389021Z","tags":null},"/reference/Medawar1964":{"title":"Medawar1964","content":"\n#### **Is the scientific paper a fraud**     \nby Medawar P.B.

We ﬁrst establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in nonequilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eour central thesis is that organisational closure should be understood as closure of constraints,aregimeof causation which is at the same time distinct from - and related to - the underlying causal regime of thermodynamic openness —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 4) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn contrast to fundamental physical equations and their underlying symmetries, constraints are contingent causes5,exertedbyspecifi —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 4) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003estructures or dynamics, which reduce the degrees of freedom of the system on which they act.

In this paper, we elaborate on Darwin’s notion of random variation to propose that biological variation should be given the status of a fundamental theoretical principle in biology. We state that biological objects such as organisms are speciﬁc objects. Speciﬁc objects are special in that they are qualitatively diﬀerent from each other. They can undergo unpredictable qualitative changes, some of which are not deﬁned before they happen. We express the principle of variation in terms of symmetry changes, where symmetries underlie the theoretical determination of the object. We contrast the biological situation with the physical situation, where objects are generic (that is, diﬀerent objects can be assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-deﬁned state spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of variation, in particular, biological objects show randomness, historicity and contextuality. We elaborate on the articulation between this principle and the two other principles proposed in this special issue: the principle of default state and the principle of organization.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe concept of “descent with modification” (Darwin, 1859, pp.119-124) —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 2) \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***The principles is inspired by Darwin, Beatty, Gould.***== Importantly, to Darwin, some of these variations would be “chance” variations, that is, changes that would be unrelated to the conditions of existence of the organisms, and even unpredictable (Darwin, 1859, p.p 131, 314)1 —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 2) \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***For Lamarck, there is no \"chance\" or random variations.

These organisms and their cells are ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or computer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints. Implementing the mathematical model shows that constraints to the default state are sufficient to explain ductal and acinar formation, and points to a target of future research, namely, to inhibitors of cell proliferation and motility generated by the epithelial cells. The success of this model suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism could be examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist perspective we embrace.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Montevil2019":{"title":"Montevil2019","content":"\n#### **Measurement in biology is methodized by theory**     \nby Montévil M.

This property is the starting point of our concept of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is relative to a natural history which is shared by the different objects subjected to the measurement and is more or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to considering biological objects as equivalent in a measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by studying objects as similar as possible, while others build on biological diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***again physic-like trends***== Biologists often use physical concepts, and measurement is no exception. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eA classical measurement has a limited precision, but knowing finite, discrete structures with a sufficient finite precision means knowing them exactly —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 2) \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***So commensurability and abstract constructs (such as space-time)***== These assumptions ensure that the measurement has a meaning —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 2) \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***Where does the principle of variation come from ?***== This idea has been developed theoretically and called the principle of variation (Montévil et al., 2016).

The analysis of free fall does not depend on the individual values of m—being real numbers most individual masses are ineffable—or on the nature of the object. Instead all possible m lead to the same analysis of trajectories. The genericity of the analysis is possible because physics is not about quantities.

These attempts use machine learning in combination with a few generic criteria that musical patterns are assumed to follow. The aim is to obtain a generic generator of acceptable soundtracks and thus to define and explore sets that have generic regularities that are assumed to be musically relevant. However, these generic regularities are not written in the algorithm, and they are not pre-stated (except for the generic criteria mentioned above). Instead, they are extracted by machine learning. Thus, the individual works of the musician rigorously preexist the definition of the generic properties extracted from machine learning and not the other way around. It follows that these generic sets are specific to the past of an individual composer or style and are subordinated to it. Moreover, assuming that there can be genuine qualitative novelties that result from probing these sets, there is no guaranty that they would be musically interesting. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 9) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn physics (and epistemologically similar modeling approaches), the relevant properties are usually generic properties. Physicists understand systems whose states are in enormous sets thanks to these generic properties and not by the specific properties of the individual possibilities (the elements of these sets).

These operations are its natural theoretical context. Music scores are used to communicate symphonies as a writing system, which means that they are typically sufficient for constraining the receiver for her to interpret some music scores as symphonies. However, the theoretical construct used to define Ms is not sufficient for a sound theoretical understanding of symphonies themselves. This limitation is not just due to Ms lacking generic constructs. Instead, the meaning of musical possibilities lies at the individual level which means that musical sense is not a generic property. Thus, Ms may only be seen as a set of pre-possibilities for symphonies and not as a set of explicit possibilities. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eWe call “pre-possibilities” sets whose meaning is not entirely explicit for the intended phenomena.

This objection requires a precise discussion. Let us call S(t) the possibility space at time t. If the observer witnesses a new possibility at time t′ \u0026gt; t, then the possibility space S(t′) is larger than S(t). The operation that we have described in the previous paragraph is retrospectively to consider St′ (t), the space of possibility at time t on the basis of a novelty that appeared between t and t′. Bergson calls conflating St′ (t) and S(t) the retrospective illusion. This illusion may be compared with the situation in usual probabilities. Using the result of a random drawing to describe the initial condition makes it always possible to describe the process as deterministic which is clearly wrong at this level of description. The novelty used to define St′ (t) by comparison with S(t) does not come from the actual behavior at t or before, ex hypothesi. The cost of conflating St′(t) and S(t) is that the definition of St depends on ulterior phenomena and becomes a finalist description: this methodology has a bias towards a specific outcome by excluding many alternative changes which are not taken into account. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 23) \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Montevil2020":{"title":"Montevil2020","content":"\n#### **Historicity at the heart of biology**     \nby Montévil M.

The underlying conception is that the historicity of biological objects would not matter to understand a situation here and now, or, at least, historicity would not impact the method of modeling. We analyze that it is not the case with concrete examples. Historicity forces a conceptual reconfiguration where equations no longer play a central role. We argue that all observations depend on objects defined by their historical origin instead of their relations as in physics.

(2020)         \n*Frontiers in Physiology* 11: 611       \nDOI: 10.3389/fphys.2020.00611     \n\n**Abstract**:  We address the identity of biological organisms at play in experimental and modeling practices. We ﬁrst examine the central tenets of two general conceptions, and we assess their respective strengths and weaknesses. The historical conception, on the one hand, characterizes organisms’ identity by looking at their past, and speciﬁcally at their genealogical connection with a common ancestor. The relational conception, on the other hand, interprets organisms’ identity by referring to a set of distinctive relations between their parts, and between the organism and its environment. While the historical and relational conceptions are understood as opposed and conﬂicting, we submit that they are also fundamentally complementary. Accordingly, we put forward a hybrid conception, in which historical and relational (and more speciﬁcally, organizational) aspects of organisms’ identity sustain and justify each other. Moreover, we argue that organisms’ identity is not only hybrid but also bounded, insofar as the compliance with speciﬁc identity criteria tends to vanish as time passes, especially across generations. We spell out the core conceptual framework of this conception, and we outline an original formal representation. We contend that the hybrid and bounded conception of organisms’ identity suits the epistemological needs of biological practices, particularly with regards to the generalization and reproducibility of experimental results, and the integration of mathematical models with experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***différance de Derrida et individuation de Simondon.***== the identity of an organism designates what makes it what it is and, thereby, what makes it different from something else. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2020, p. 1) \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***ok this is really from simondon and derrida***== individuation, i.e., the fact of possessing those properties that allow drawing its boundaries and discriminating it from the surroundings. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2020, p. 2) \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003e==***identity as unicity can only be true numerically (x=y).

However, both energy and minerals correspond to fundamentally conserved quantities from the perspective of physics. A specific concept is required to understand the rarefaction of available resources. This concept, entropy, pertains to energy and matter configurations and not just to their sheer amount. However, the physics concept of entropy is insufficient to understand biological and social organizations. Biological phenomena display both historicity and systemic properties. A biological organization, the ability of a specific living being to last over time, results from history, expresses itself by systemic properties, and may require generating novelties The concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination of these features.

Nonetheless, the notion of disruption has not yet been theorized in biology. To progress in that regard, we work on a special case. Relatively minor temperature changes impact plant-pollinator synchrony, disrupting mutualistic interaction networks. Understanding this phenomenon requires a speciﬁc rationale since models describing them use both historical and systemic reasoning. Speciﬁcally, history justiﬁes that the system is initially in a very narrow part of the possibility space where it is viable, and the disruption randomizes this conﬁguration. Building on this rationale, we develop a formal framework inspired by Boltzmann’s entropy. With empirical networks, we show historical trends depending on latitude. Then we propose an initial deﬁnition of disruption in ecology. When a speciﬁc historical outcome contributes to a system’s viability, disruption randomizes this outcome, decreasing viability.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Moreno2015":{"title":"Moreno2015","content":"\n#### **Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and Theoretical Enquiry**     \nby Moreno A., Mossio M.

The core of the argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination: biological organisation determines itself in the sense that the effects of its activity contribute to determine its own conditions of existence. We suggest that not any kind of circular regime realises self-determination, which should be speciﬁcally understood as self-constraint: in biological systems, in particular, selfconstraint takes the form of closure, i.e. a network of mutually dependent constitutive constraints. We then explore the occurrence of intrinsic teleology in the biological domain and beyond. On the one hand, the organisational account might possibly concede that supra-organismal biological systems (as symbioses or ecosystems) could realise closure, and hence be teleological. On the other hand, the realisation of closure beyond the biological realm appears to be highly unlikely. In turn, the occurrence of simpler forms of self-determination remains a controversial issue, in particular with respect to the case of self-organising dissipative systems.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe organisation of biological systems is inherently teleological, which means that its own activity is, in a fundamental sense, first and foremost oriented toward an end. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eThe core of our argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003ethe teleology is extrinsic for the case of artefacts, and intrinsic for the case of biological systems (Jonas 1966) —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 2) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eself-determination grounds teleology because it takes the specific form of self-constraint —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003econstraints subject to closure correspond to biological functions. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eif circular causation does not occur as self-constraint, it amounts instead to a chain of transformations in which the system as a whole plays no role in specifying its own dynamics, and these dynamics are sufficiently determined by the external boundary conditions. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eself-constraint implies that the circular organisation specifies its own dynamics: that is why only self-constraint involves selfdetermination, and why biological organisation (by realising closure) is teleological. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 3) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003esince the nineteenth century teleology has been replaced by other principles (geodesics, Le Chatelier’s, second law of thermodynamics, attractors...),1 that account for the tendency of physical systems to reach certain stable “goal states”, even under perturbations, without appealing to an inversion of the temporal relation between causes and effects. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 4) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eDarwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection (Darwin 1859), and Bernard’s notion of conservation of the internal milieu (Bernard 1865).

The underlying theoretical framework is that of (mainly French) molecular biology, centred on the notion of program (Jacob and Monod 1961; Mayr 1961; Jacob 1970; Monod 1970). In this line of thought, the concept of genetic program, in the context of Darwinian evolution, rehabilitates teleology (Jacob 1970,p.9)as an admissible scientific dimension. The central idea is that teleological behaviours, which control the form, as well as the adaptivity of biological organisms, are subtended by genetic molecular mechanisms.9 In turn, these mechanisms, by enabling the reproduction of the organism, determine the conditions of its own persistence. In this perspective, therefore, the goal is not extrinsic, but rather intrinsic to the system, since it is specified by a program that determines its future states. The program, in turn, has been specified by evolution (Jacob 1970,p.8) —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 8) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eIn doing so, Piaget elaborates the crucial theoretical concept of organisational closure, which he considers as complementary to that of thermodynamic openness, already emphasised by von Bertalanffy (1949) —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 10) \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eAccording to them, autopoietic systems are systems without goals.

To solve this problem, we have used machine learning, traditional document ingestion methods, and a network of researchers to develop a “smart citation index” called scite, which categorizes citations based on context. Scite shows how a citation was used by displaying the surrounding textual context from the citing paper and a classification from our deep learning model that indicates whether the statement provides supporting or contrasting evidence for a referenced work, or simply mentions it. Scite has been developed by analyzing over 25 million full-text scientific articles and currently has a database of more than 880 million classified citation statements.

He can be regarded, therefore, as the first systems biologist. The new vogue for systems biology today is an important development, since it is time to complement reductionist molecular biology by integrative approaches. Claude Bernard foresaw that this would require the application of mathematics to biology. This aspect of Claude Bernard's work has been neglected by physiologists, which is why we are not as ready to contribute to the development of systems biology as we should be. In this paper, I outline some general principles that could form the basis of systems biology as a truly multilevel approach from a physiologist's standpoint. We need the insights obtained from higher-level analysis in order to succeed even at the lower levels. The reason is that higher levels in biological systems impose boundary conditions on the lower levels. Without understanding those conditions and their effects, we will be seriously restricted in understanding the logic of living systems. The principles outlined are illustrated with examples from various aspects of physiology and biochemistry. Applying and developing these principles should form a major part of the future of physiology.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Noble2014":{"title":"Noble2014","content":"\n#### **Evolution evolves: physiology returns to centre stage**     \nby Noble D., Jablonka E., Joyner M.J., Müller G.B., Omholt S.W.

This article examines the conceptual framework of neo-Darwinism, including the concepts of 'gene', 'selfish', 'code', 'program', 'blueprint', 'book of life', 'replicator' and 'vehicle'. This form of representation is a barrier to extending or replacing existing theory as it confuses conceptual and empirical matters. These need to be clearly distinguished. In the case of the central concept of 'gene', the definition has moved all the way from describing a necessary cause (defined in terms of the inheritable phenotype itself) to an empirically testable hypothesis (in terms of causation by DNA sequences). Neo-Darwinism also privileges 'genes' in causation, whereas in multi-way networks of interactions there can be no privileged cause. An alternative conceptual framework is proposed that avoids these problems, and which is more favourable to an integrated systems view of evolution.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Nolan2021":{"title":"Nolan2021","content":"\n#### **Making life richer, easier and healthier: Robots, their future and the roles for public policy**     \nby Nolan A.

Governance settings contribute overall to a more inclusive, transparent and responsible STI system, in particular through a whole-of-government approach, the consultation of academia, the private sector and civil society, the implementation of strategies by professional agencies, and the increasingly common use of evaluation. Several critical dimensions facilitate the success of STI policies. They include a commitment at the highest level of government, strong public-private collaboration in R\u0026amp;D, continuous evaluation and improvement, a “mission-oriented” approach, coherence of policies and flexibility in setting priorities, as well as overall harmonisation and rationalisation of programmes in order to maximise efficiency and reduce duplication.\n\n\n\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003eCommitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eMission-oriented” policies aiming to resolve grand societal challenges —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eSystematic evaluation and monitoring enables governments to continuously improve the policy framework and ensure increasing impact over time. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eGovernments need to demonstrate flexibility in setting priorities to be able to respond to increasingly rapid technological and societal evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 6) \n\n\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e\n\u003eAvailable programmes are being harmonised and rationalised, to simplify and optimise target stakeholders’ access to the available subsidies and programmes.

(1988)         \nPerseus Books      \n\n**Abstract**:  Evolution of self-replicating macromolecules through natural selection is a dynamically ordered process. Two concepts are introduced to describe the physical regularity of macromolecular evolution: sequence space and quasi-species. Natural selection means localization of a mutant distribution in sequence space. This localized distribution, called the quasi-species, is centered around a master sequence (or a degenerate set), that the biologist would call the wild-type. The self-ordering of such a system is an essential consequence of its formation through self-reproduction of its macromolecular consti tuents, a process that in the dynamical equations expresses itself by positive diagonal coefficients called selective values. The theory describes how population numbers of wild type and mutants are related to the distribution of selective values, that is to say, how value topography maps into population topography. For selectively (nearly) neutral mutants appearing in the quasi- species distribution, population numbers are greatly enhanced as compared to those of disadvantageous mutants, even more so in continuous domains of such selectively valuable mutants. As a consequence, mutants far distant from the wild type may occur because they are produced with the help of highly populated, less distant precursors. Since values are cohesively distributed, like mountains on earth, and since their positions are multiply connected in the high-dimensional sequence space, the overpopulation of (nearly) neural mutants provides guidance for the evolutionary process. Localization in sequence space, subject to a threshold in the fidelity of reproduction, is steadily challenged until an optimal state is reached. The model has been designed according to experimentally determined properties of self-replicating molecules. The conclusions reached from the theoretical models can be used to construct machines that provide optimal conditions for the evolution of functional macromolecules.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Polanyi1962":{"title":"Polanyi1962","content":"\n#### **The Republic of science**     \nby Polanyi M.

In this way, they became an important organ of the ‘Republic of Science’ (Michael Polanyi's concept). Being awarded a grant is now as important for the reputation or status of a scientist as the money value per se: research councils have become part of the reward system of science. Credibility-cycle analysis (Latour and Woolgar) is used to show this; and then applied to the research council itself, between the State and the national scientific community. Current concerns about proposal success rates and conservatism are analysed in terms of dynamics of this research world. This sociological approach to research councils allows analysis of changes in the reward system of science (where ‘relevance’ is becoming an accepted criterion world-wide) and of the complex environment of research councils, where many actors now compete for the intermediary role. Research councils must also become entrepreneurial-or become obsolete.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Ripple2017":{"title":"Ripple2017","content":"\n#### **World scientists’ warning to humanity: a second notice**     \nby Ripple W.J., Wolf C., Newsome T.M., Galetti M., Alamgir M., Crist E., Mahmoud M.I., Laurance W.F., 15 3.C.

(2022)         \n\n**Abstract**:  Artificial intelligence has made tremendous advances since its inception about seventy years ago. Self-driving cars, programs beating experts at complex games, and smart robots capable of assisting people that need care are just some among the successful examples of machine intelligence. This kind of progress might entice us to envision a society populated by autonomous robots capable of performing the same tasks humans do in the near future. This prospect seems limited only by the power and complexity of current computational devices, which is improving fast. However, there are several significant obstacles on this path. General intelligence involves situational reasoning, taking perspectives, choosing goals, and an ability to deal with ambiguous information. We observe that all of these characteristics are connected to the ability of identifying and exploiting new affordances—opportunities (or impediments) on the path of an agent to achieve its goals. A general example of an affordance is the use of an object in the hands of an agent. We show that it is impossible to predefine a list of such uses. Therefore, they cannot be treated algorithmically. This means that “AI agents” and organisms differ in their ability to leverage new affordances. Only organisms can do this. This implies that true AGI is not achievable in the current algorithmic frame of AI research. It also has important consequences for the theory of evolution. We argue that organismic agency is strictly required for truly open-ended evolution through radical emergence. We discuss the diverse ramifications of this argument, not only in AI research and evolution, but also for the philosophy of science.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Rosen1991":{"title":"Rosen1991","content":"\n#### **Life itself: a comprehensive inquiry into the nature, origin, and fabrication of life**     \nby Rosen R.

I point out an alternative. The subsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small number of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to depends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe depends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low past entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate of the universe) is non-generic.

In this study, we deploy an approach based on change instead of on levels of inputs and outputs: an approach that to a large extent eliminates the problem of measurement differences between countries. We firstly show that there are large differences in efficiency between national science systems, defined as the increase in output (highly cited papers) per percentage increase in input (funding). We then discuss our findings using popular explanations of performance differences: differences in funding systems (performance related or not), differences in the level of competition, differences in the level of university autonomy, and differences in the level of academic freedom. Interestingly, the available data do not support these common explanations. What the data suggest is that efficient systems are characterized by a well-developed ex post evaluation system combined with considerably high institutional funding and relatively low university autonomy (meaning a high autonomy of professionals). On the other hand, the less efficient systems have a strong ex ante control, either through a high level of so-called competitive project funding, or through strong power of the university management. Another conclusion is that more and better data are needed.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Schrodinger1944":{"title":"Schrodinger1944","content":"\n#### **What is Life?: With Mind and Matter and Autobiographical Sketches**     \nby Schrödinger E.

A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Schwartz2015":{"title":"Schwartz2015","content":"\n#### **Why we work**     \nby Schwartz B.

Other ‘relevance’ pressures include drives for public accountability, pressure for the ‘democratisation’ of science and demands from industry for usable knowledge. Underlying the question of the social relevance of science is the matter of decision-making and quality control in science, usually via the peer-review process. Peer review plays a central role in many of the key moments in science. It is the main form of decision-making around grant selection, academic publishing and the promotion of individual scientists within universities and research institutions. It also underpins methods used to evaluate scientific institutions. Yet, peer review as currently practised can be narrowly scientific, to the exclusion of other pressing quality criteria relating to social relevance. It is often also controlled and practised by scientists to the exclusion of wider groups that might bring valuable perspectives. This article sets out to examine peer review through the lens of social relevance. It challenges peer review as currently practised and makes some suggestions for ways forward.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Shannon1948":{"title":"Shannon1948","content":"\n#### **A mathematical theory of communication**     \nby Shannon C.E.

Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype-phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution-such as punctuation, irreversibility, modularity--result naturally from the properties of this space. The classical framework, however, addresses these patterns by exclusively invoking natural selection on suitably imposed fitness landscapes. We propose to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the genotype-phenotype map. We introduce the mathematical concepts and tools necessary to formalize the notion of accessibility pre-topology relative to which we can speak of continuity in the genotype-phenotype map and in evolutionary trajectories. We connect the factorization of a pre-topology into a product space with the notion of phenotypic character and derive a condition for factorization. Based on anecdotal evidence from the RNA model, we conjecture that this condition is not globally fulfilled, but rather confined to regions where the genotype-phenotype map is continuous. Equivalently, local regions of genotype space on which the map is discontinuous are associated with the loss of character autonomy. This is consistent with the importance of these regions for phenotypic innovation. The intention of the present paper is to offer a perspective, a framework to implement this perspective, and a few results illustrating how this framework can be put to work. The RNA case is used as an example throughout the text.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Stephan2015":{"title":"Stephan2015","content":"\n#### **How economics shapes science**     \nby Stephan P.

In these gravely perilous times, we must bifurcate: there is no alternative.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Tang2004":{"title":"Tang2004","content":"\n#### **Indian hedgehog: a mechanotransduction mediator in condylar cartilage**     \nby Tang G.H., Rabie A.M., Hägg U.

Partant d'une approche comparative, elle se fonde sur des distinctions entre modèles conçues en termes de fonction épistémique, de nature et de principe. Elle propose en particulier d'identifier 20 différentes fonctions épistémiques pour les modèles contemporains. Elle distingue également trois types distincts de simulation sur ordinateur en fonction de leur usage épistémique des symboles oeuvrant dans la computation. Elle distingue enfin les simulations de modèles des modèles de simulation, les modèles de simulation pouvant eux-mêmes finalement être subdivisés encore en 2 catégories distinctes.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/VonBertalanffy1952":{"title":"VonBertalanffy1952","content":"\n#### **Problems of Life.

Internal selective processes operating on premutational disturbances, on mutations, and on developmental phases may usefully be separated from the adaptive selection of phenotypes.2.The precise structural and morphological consequences of internal factors should soon become an isolable problem owing to a) the observational correlation of definite changes in hereditary specificity with particular developmental consequences; and b) the progressive theoretical identification of the coordinative conditions in organisms.3.Increasing clarity regarding the coordinative conditions should throw light on the “mutational selection rules” and on the differentiative mutations which led to the most important steps in the past history of evolution.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T15:43:24.787890167Z","tags":null},"/reference/Wiener1948":{"title":"Wiener1948","content":"\n#### **Cybernetics: or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine**     \nby Wiener N.
