(2020)<br><em>Frontiers in Physiology</em> 11: 611</p><p>Reference:
<a href=/reference/Montevil2020a/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Montevil2020a/>Montevil2020a</a></p><a href=#what-is-identity-why-defining-it><h3 id=what-is-identity-why-defining-it><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is identity? Why defining it?</h3></a><p>The concept identity for organisms can be more or less restricted. The largest is <em>individuation</em>, which is having the propreties drawing its own boundaries and discriminating itself from the surrounding. All organisms fall into the same reference class if identity is defined as such. The narrowest is <em>unicity</em>, i.e. having the exactly the same set the properties. They each reference class as one element. In practice we want somehting in between, but it depends on what we want. In the following, the purpose is to do experiments and model organisms.</p><p>They are two conceptions of biological identities. One is rather used in experimental biology. One controls the <em>historical aspect</em> of organisms, usually solely the <em>genealogical</em> aspect. It has the advantage of using organisms as &ldquo;wholes&rdquo;, despite their complexities. A bat is a bat because it has a given ancestor that was named bat and that it shares with other bats. In experimental biology,
<a href=/concept/symmetrization/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/concept/symmetrization/>symmetrization</a> is the process of (concretely of epistemically) positing a reference class (see
<a href=/note/note-on-Montevil2019/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/note/note-on-Montevil2019/>note on Montevil2019</a>), usually by controlling the history. The limit of this conception is that you do not control how many variations occured before the last ancestor (&ldquo;name-bearing type&rdquo;) or your last control. For instance, snakes are tetrapods because we refer to a common ancestor to name them like that. More generally, we can have no common properties because of variations, and be within the same reference class. However, the implicit but fundamental assumption is that closer in genealogy means closer in organizational terms (thin bottle neck in experimental practices).</p><p>On the other hand, the <em>relational</em> aspect says that a bat is a bat if it has the relevant properties of a bat. This makes explicit what are the properties taken into account in modeling or experimental practices with mathematico-physical models. It is usually not properly justified that you can neglect some parts (closure of organisms for instance) or pick certain values of parameters to imitate what you see (
<a href=/reference/Montevil2020/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Montevil2020/>Montevil2020</a>,
<a href=/note/note-on-Montevil2016-and-Montevil2020/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/note/note-on-Montevil2016-and-Montevil2020/>note on Montevil2016 and Montevil2020</a>). Those mathematical structures are not stable with respect to the flow of time so the identity is <em>bounded</em> in time. There are unpredictable variations. This is the crucial problem with this approach whose abstract some parts of the organism. The second problem is that one needs to define what is a bat, therefore taking one specific individual and modeling it as a reference — this leads to a large number of variability which make models useless in practice. Moreover only the aspects that are incorporated in the model are taken into account. Missing aspects (that always play a role because of closure) are forgotten.</p><p>One could choose one or the other view and be satisftied because 1) based on Darwin&rsquo;s view of evolution or 2) just lack of epistemic knowledge but otherwise, it is good. Or we can say that both are need and complement each other. <em>It is always a matter of perspective.</em> Be careful not to confuse with synchronic and diachronic, it is not the same mapping. The relational conception has those two aspect, and the genealogical one also.</p><p>The idea is that the genealogical conception provides <em>whole organisms</em> as candidates for identity classes. The relational conception, in turn, details the relevant parts for the purpose of the model/experiment.</p><a href=#organization-approach-of-the-relational-conception><h3 id=organization-approach-of-the-relational-conception><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Organization approach of the relational conception</h3></a><p>The organizational approach of the relational conception of identity can be more or less inclusive. 1) They all have the same constraints (have the same mathematico-physical structure that constraint the same process) 2) they realize closure. The last definition is important for the identity of the same individual during development. This is <em>organizational continuity</em>. We prefer the other aspect. Note that the emphasis is on the qualitaative and not quantitative aspects.</p><p>However, there is the same problem of having to make explicit the entire closure (though now closure is to be established). Therefore, one uses <em>partial closure</em>. It is different from local biophysical models. Same objection: you miss stuffs. Yes but I have closure so I may capture more relevant stuffs (reciprocal stabilization of constraints).</p><p>In some experimental situation, a group of organism can share some <em>generic</em> properties. The only way for them to share aspects, here constraints, is from common history. In fact, closure can explain stability across generations (
<a href=/reference/Mossio2022/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Mossio2022/>Mossio2022</a>). At the evolutionnary time scale, <a href=/concept/natural-selection rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/concept/natural-selection>natural selection</a> provides the rationale.</p><a href=#hybrid-and-bounded-identity><h3 id=hybrid-and-bounded-identity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hybrid and bounded identity</h3></a><p>To characterize an identity you need:</p><ul><li>A <em>generic</em> description of <em>partial</em> closure to <em>abstract</em> a group of organisms and their environment (with means other organisms).</li><li>A <em>complementary</em> reference to a <em>recent</em> common ancestor to take into account the neglected aspects of the relational model (such as past contexts or fonctions).</li></ul><p>For instance, this makes the distinction between organisms with funcitonnal <mark><em>homology</em></mark> and <mark><em>analogy</em></mark>, because we need to precise a recent common ancestor say that it is identical. This prevents physicist to analyze the eye of mammal or cephalopods with the same optical model. To be identical means that you have the same historical origin (or hidden numerous relational properties) <em>and</em> that you can be described by the same physico-mathematical structure. Therefore your identity is <em>hybrid</em>.</p><p>The characterization of closure puts the emphasis on explaining how organisms maintain themselves in time, on stability. It actually determines what kind of variations is likely to be preserved and exclude other (like DNA mutation if you don&rsquo;t look at DNA). In that case, you will have a different functional regime and a change of identity (following our definition of identity). This is way you identity is <em>bounded</em> in time.</p><p>Also, while organizational proximity is an unjustified but a fundamental hypothesis in general, the use of closure <em>provides a theoretical support</em> for cross-generational organization proximity (
<a href=/reference/Mossio2022/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Mossio2022/>Mossio2022</a>). In other words, there is an argumentation for the &ldquo;short arrow&rdquo; in the viable organismal macrostate. If functional novelties take time and variations, you can use for several generations the same common ancestor as a reference.</p><p>The identity class shrinks when the common ancestors is more recent or when the relational aspects are more explicited.</p><a href=#introducing-chi><h3 id=introducing-chi><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Introducing $\chi$</h3></a><p>$\chi$ is all what is not made explicit by the relational description, that is what has not been abstracted. It is a symbol in the etymological sense: it point to a specific and material object of the world.</p><p>$\chi$ is part of the closure. In some sense, $\chi$ could be unpacked into fully relational aspects that are generic, i.e. shared by individuals that stem from a common descent. However, this is not feasible in practice and would just use $\chi$ to fill the unknown. At the end of the day, this hybrid identity would be useless. In any case, $\chi$ is irreducible to fully relational aspect (be it for principled or practical reasons).</p><p>Rather, $\chi$ is the reminder that some arguments should be given with a relational description.</p><p>Using $\chi$ to realize closure makes you think of justifying the closure by giving instances of partial closure with $\chi$ (see Fig3b). In fact, Fig3a is what is done in biophysics: it is implicitely assumed that closure is realized (i.e. that the result of my simulation maintain the boundary conditions I use) wihtout proper justifications.</p><blockquote class=warning-callout><p></p><p>Another way to point out one limiting aspect of the epistemology of physics is that you boundary/initial conditions, external parameters of you equation does not depend on the results of your model. You fix it with a steady hand, the one of the manufacturer building the model as an artefact.</p></blockquote><p><img src=https://weaverbird.net//images/Pasted%20image%2020230404124000.png width=auto alt></p><p>The role that plays $\chi$ when linked to other constraints depends on what one knows about the organisms. For instance, it can be the place of a rationale for justifying some boundary conditions maintained by processes constrained generically, or how an explicited constrain helps maintaining some other generic process. In cases of partial closure, constraints necesserally have multiple functions. Cases of partial closure are needed to justify the use of biophysical models afterwards. In other words, the starting point is never the relational closure. It is always the hybrid closure with $\chi$.</p><p><img src=https://weaverbird.net//images/Pasted%20image%2020230405123654.png width=auto alt></p><p>If, from an identity class or diagram $\mathcal{D}^0$ you unpack some relational aspects from $\chi$ , you have a more restricted identity class or diagram $\mathcal{D}^1$. Depending on what you want to do, you might want to be more general and still use $\mathcal{D}^0$. The knowledge of being able to define $\mathcal{D}^1$ is not lost and you ca define a <mark><em>type</em></mark> $\mathcal{D}^0[\mathcal{D}^1]$, that is an instance of $\mathcal{D}^0$ that helps you argue about $\chi$ without commiting in expliciting it. The idea is to be able to be representative. You can also have more types $\mathcal{D}^0[\mathcal{D}^{1,1},\mathcal{D}^{1,2},&mldr;]$ to taken into account some diversity. This moves as an epistemological role: it shows that a diversity of explicted different constraints can maintain the same generic process for instance.</p><p>Lastly, $\chi$ can accomodate for unpredictable variations that <em>may appear</em>. You can define types that are valid <em>at different times</em>: $\mathcal{D}<em>{t_1}^{0}[\mathcal{D}^{1,1}</em>{t_2},\mathcal{D}^{1,2}<em>{t_2},&mldr;]$.<br>In other words, $\chi$ can be used as a &ldquo;propulsive constraint&rdquo;, that is one that promotes the appearance of unpredictable novelties. In other words, we know that something will probably happen, but we don&rsquo;t know what. However, to discuss the propulsive constraint, you need to use types to make it explicit because e.g. $\mathcal{D}^{1,1}</em>{t_2}$ does not include it.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.37c7ce6d0a8ab8682befb2a374960c0b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=https://weaverbird.net/>Back to global graph</a></li><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
