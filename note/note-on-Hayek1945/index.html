Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>(&mldr;) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. —
<a href=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/ rel=noopener>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.</a></p></blockquote><a href=#decentralization-is-the-most-efficient-organization-to-react-quickly-to-changes><h4 id=decentralization-is-the-most-efficient-organization-to-react-quickly-to-changes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes</h4></a><p>According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly <em>adapting to changes</em> (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>the sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form — (Hayek, 1945, p. 7)</p></blockquote><p>In practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> —, the organization should build on knowledge <em>decentralization</em>.</p><a href=#prices-evolution-act-as-instructions-for-self-interested-actors><h4 id=prices-evolution-act-as-instructions-for-self-interested-actors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors</h4></a><p>How, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their <em>relative</em> consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the <em>price mechanism</em> channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives <em>instructions</em>. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>It is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment — (Hayek, 1945, p. 8)</p></blockquote><p>The more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market <em>self-regulation</em>.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>It is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement. — (Hayek, 1945, p. 10)</p></blockquote><a href=#the-market-mechanism-as-a-wider-range-of-applicability-social-phenomena><h4 id=the-market-mechanism-as-a-wider-range-of-applicability-social-phenomena><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)</h4></a><p>The decentralized plans of <em>self-interested actors</em> — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the <em>competition</em> for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. — (Hayek, 1945, p. 11)</p></blockquote><a href=#comments><h4 id=comments><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Comments</h4></a><ul><li>Knowledge cannot be reduced to digits. This echoes the informational metaphor in biology. It tends to consider negatively (as noise) everything that cannot be digitalized, here even reduced to a single number. See

Individuals cannot influence themselves. No mimetism.</li><li>The market needs an exogeous cause to change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. In practice, external events perturbing the cost of one commodity do occur all the time so that everything happen <em>as if</em> prices were evolving because commodities were traded.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.c2737d3ec1f70c1ec909ea32322fcfe8.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li><li><a href=/About-me>About me</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
