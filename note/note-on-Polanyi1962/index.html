Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek (
<a href=/reference/Fischer2009/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Fischer2009/>Fischer2009</a>). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of <em>tacit knowledge</em> will be used by the OECD later.</p><p>In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith&rsquo;s “invisible hand”, his model is <em>market-inspired</em>. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek (
<a href=/reference/Hayek1945/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Hayek1945/>Hayek1945</a>), because it has a <em>higher principle</em>.</p><a href=#science-is-made-by-mutual-adjustment-of-independent-initiatives><h5 id=science-is-made-by-mutual-adjustment-of-independent-initiatives><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives.</h5></a><p>Polanyi&rsquo;s original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a <em>mutual adjustement of independent initiatives</em>, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>While Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).</p><a href=#self-interested-scientists-refer-to-the-scientific-standards><h5 id=self-interested-scientists-refer-to-the-scientific-standards><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards</h5></a><p>However, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest <em>problem</em> given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist&rsquo;s intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:</p><ol><li>Plausibility</li><li>Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.</li><li>Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists</li></ol><a href=#the-authority-is-enforced-by-the-scientists-themselves><h5 id=the-authority-is-enforced-by-the-scientists-themselves><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves</h5></a><p>The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using <em>overlapping neighborhoods</em>. The fragmentized <em>scientific opinion</em> is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists.</p><a href=#the-tension-of-scientific-standards-is-the-source-for-the-evolution-of-science><h5 id=the-tension-of-scientific-standards-is-the-source-for-the-evolution-of-science><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science</h5></a><p>Moreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a <em>dynamical orthodoxy,</em> that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences <em>traditional</em>: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. — (

<a href=/reference/Morin1982/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Morin1982/>Morin1982</a> would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin&rsquo;s dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin&rsquo;s spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.</li><li>Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the <em>appreciation</em> of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the <em>historicity</em> of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</li></ul><blockquote class=warning-callout><p></p><p>Neoliberalism was not the dominant ideology in the Western world at that time. The Republic of Science is more related to a liberal view of science, in the classical view, without state intervention. Sixty years later, we find an era of neoliberalism in science (
