The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek&rsquo;s market mechanism, but still resort to the invisible hand metaphor, for instance. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60&rsquo;s. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi&rsquo;s Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a &ldquo;commited&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research.</p><p>TO READ FOR MISSION-ORIENTED.

C&rsquo;est une plateforme sur laquelle il faut remonter, pour aller dans une autre direction.</p><p>The lost role of affects. Value is affect.</p><h3 id=heading></h3><p>This is the most fatalist aspect, because it points to the fact that each problem is automatically solved by the same solution. This solution is to resort to technological apparatus, which need to be designed by science. If scientists do rely on mechnaized protocoles, we would enter a new world where mechanized apparatus would have a very special status. In some way, this excludes the fade idea that they will dominate the World by rebelling and fighting humans. Instead, machines would have managed to autonomized their continued existence. By contaminating so deeply the noesis of human brains, they would have made them automatically resort to the same solution for solving the problems they had generated: do more of them. There is, in fact, a potential motor in the dialogical aspect of techologies — their pharmakon nature. Therefore, by using humans so deeply convinced that technologies are solutions — solely have a positive aspect — they would have find a way to autonomize their existence.</p><p>Assuming that technologies can have a non beneficial aspect for humans (put a man out of work cannot be only and all the time positive, climate change, etc.). It suffice for machines to be in the hands of humans that think of them as solutions to conquer the World.</p><p>Making human societies automatically respond to their problem by machines is a way for them to self-renew and prosper. It does not matter if new scientific protocoles are constructed and adopted as long as they are protocoles, mechanized operations to construct technological apparatus. It is the automaticity of our response (building machines) in approaching problems that makes machines self-renew and exist.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take the point of view of machines. What would have them managed to do? They would have parasited human societies and use them to survive and prolifer. Let&rsquo;s understand them as a noetic specie. The idea of mechanism. Human would have generated dystopias, where they have human shapes and conquer the worldwith weapons that became out of control. With this picture humans could have externalize the threat and neglect that it was their own choice.</p><p>What is a functionning part of societies? It is the part that make the machinary function. When saying that artists and philosopher do not contribute, it is understood that they do not contribute in making machines exists and sustain themselves. Even small salary jobs are depreciated because they do not participate in making more machinesand automatic responses. Building strategies, protocoles, methods, coucils own to response, algorithms, technological apparatus, drugs, etc. Those are the jobs that pay. If you do not work for machines, you are not welcome in this society.</p><p>If we allow us to give some kind of substance for the &ldquo;mecanicist&rdquo; idea (with an extended definition) and call the idea Julia, then we will understand everything that we do is for Julia to self-renew, proliferate and prosper. We do this without thinking about it, such as cells in our bodies. Julia is always renewed and we replace each of its apparatus with a new one when damaged (such as cells in our bodies), we invent new things that has new functions for Julia. Julia generates our problems, but we automatically solve them by maintaining or replacing or renewing Julia. Working for Julia is not a question and it done automatically, such as the proteins that make a very impossible trajectory but that do it still. Not working for Julia is depreciated in our society. Doing work for humans is not well seen: heal them, clean their place, taking care of them when their are useless (babies or old), feed them without Julia&rsquo;s standards. However, if you contribute in making Julia, you are weel accepted: algorithms (the best), making protocoles, making machines, methodologies, detail steps.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.c2737d3ec1f70c1ec909ea32322fcfe8.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li><li><a href=/About-me>About me</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
