Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. In practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> —, the organization should build on knowledge <em>decentralization</em>.</p><a href=#prices-evolution-act-as-instructions-for-self-interested-actors><h5 id=prices-evolution-act-as-instructions-for-self-interested-actors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors</h5></a><p>How, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their <em>relative</em> consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the <em>price mechanism</em> channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives <em>instructions</em>. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. The more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market <em>self-regulation</em>.</p><a href=#the-market-mechanism-as-a-wider-range-of-applicability-social-phenomena><h5 id=the-market-mechanism-as-a-wider-range-of-applicability-social-phenomena><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)</h5></a><p>The decentralized plans of <em>self-interested actors</em> — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the <em>competition</em> for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (as he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” In short,</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>The problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. — (Hayek, 1945, p. 11)</p></blockquote><h3 id=polanyis-republic-of-science-literature-note-on-polanyi1962noteliterature20note20on20polanyi1962md>Polanyi&rsquo;s Republic of Science (
<a href=/note/literature-note-on-Polanyi1962/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/note/literature-note-on-Polanyi1962/>literature note on Polanyi1962</a>)</h3><p>Micheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek (
<a href=/reference/Fischer2009/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Fischer2009/>Fischer2009</a>). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith&rsquo;s “invisible hand”, his model is <em>market-inspired</em>. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek (
<a href=/reference/Hayek1945/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Hayek1945/>Hayek1945</a>), because it has a <em>higher principle</em>.</p><a href=#science-is-made-by-mutual-adjustment-of-independent-initiatives><h5 id=science-is-made-by-mutual-adjustment-of-independent-initiatives><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives.</h5></a><p>Polanyi&rsquo;s original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a <em>mutual adjustement of independent initiatives</em>, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. While Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).</p><a href=#self-interested-scientists-refer-to-the-scientific-standards><h5 id=self-interested-scientists-refer-to-the-scientific-standards><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards</h5></a><p>However, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest <em>problem</em> given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve.

The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using <em>overlapping neighborhoods</em>. The fragmentized <em>scientific opinion</em> is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists.</p><a href=#the-tension-of-scientific-standards-is-the-source-for-the-evolution-of-science><h5 id=the-tension-of-scientific-standards-is-the-source-for-the-evolution-of-science><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science</h5></a><p>Moreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a <em>dynamical orthodoxy,</em> that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion.

First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer:</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>If governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. (OECD, 1966: 8) — Government and Technical Innovation, Paris: OECD.</p></blockquote><p>This input/output continuous model being <em>de facto</em> extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays (
<a href=/reference/Petit2019/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Petit2019/>Petit2019</a>). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good.</p><p>Second, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two blocs threats each other with nuclear weapon. There is a need for being able to plan research activities.</p><p>Third, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists (

It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S&T led by a group of experts. The model it constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years (
<a href=/reference/Henriques2013/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Henriques2013/>Henriques2013</a>). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report (
<a href=/reference/Bush1945/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Bush1945/>Bush1945</a>) and the work of experts of the OECD (
<a href=/reference/Piganiol1963/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Piganiol1963/>Piganiol1963</a>).</p><a href=#the-model-centralizes-the-planning-of-science-to-insure-economic-growth><h4 id=the-model-centralizes-the-planning-of-science-to-insure-economic-growth><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth</h4></a><p>The OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needssome fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate resources on specific research area. Accordingly, quantitative indicators must be developed to assess to quality of science and refine policies: this is the birth of the Frascati manual, still in used nowadays.</p><h2 id=frankensteins-invisible-hand-pushing-scientists-towards-green-sustainable-economic-growth-literature-note-on-paic2019noteliterature20note20on20paic2019md>Frankenstein&rsquo;s invisible hand pushing scientists towards green, sustainable economic growth (

It will change it by several political reforms, led by the OECD. First, some aspects are retained or slightly modified. Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs. The linear model is modified to include &ldquo;tacit knowledge&rdquo; (another idea of Polanyi). For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. Despite the strong trend in public-private collaboration, more is &ldquo;strongly encouraged&rdquo;.</p><p>The major shift is that the governement should no longer plan what science should do. It should follow what &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain, public and private sector.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>Commitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. — (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5)</p></blockquote><p>In Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processig software and filtering out the majority by an unknown proecss, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the &ldquo;ivory tower&rdquo; of scientists, making them play a role in daily life. Government should be <em>flexible</em> because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficcient (i.e. all the problems raised by Hayek).</p><p>The second shift is about the design of &ldquo;mission-oriented&rdquo; policies to solve grand societal challenges, top-down initiatives responding &ldquo;to the needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support&rdquo;. The rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councis/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon.</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>To engage people.

The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin&rsquo;s dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved.

Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. There is no signal for true novelties that cannot be predicted. Science is a bet with no insurance.
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.

Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited.
