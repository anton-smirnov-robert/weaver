Hayek&rsquo;s market system, Polanyi&rsquo;s Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect.
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process.</p><a href=#introduction><h2 id=introduction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Introduction</h2></a><a href=#definition-of-a-mechanistic-system-and-organization><h2 id=definition-of-a-mechanistic-system-and-organization><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Definition of a mechanistic system and organization</h2></a><p><img src=https://weaverbird.net//concept/mechanistic%20system.md width=auto alt="mechanistic system"></p><p><img src=https://weaverbird.net//concept/mechanistic%20organization.md width=auto alt="mechanistic organization"></p><a href=#application-to-hayeks-market-system><h2 id=application-to-hayeks-market-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Application to Hayek&rsquo;s market system</h2></a><p><a href=/note/literature-note-on-Hayek1945/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/note/literature-note-on-Hayek1945/>literature note on Hayek1945</a></p><p>We sketch the essence of a market organization (
<a href=/reference/Hayek1945/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Hayek1945/>Hayek1945</a>) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p></p><p>(&mldr;) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. —
<a href=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/ rel=noopener>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.</a></p></blockquote><p>According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly <em>adapting to changes</em> (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). For this reason, the organization should build on knowledge <em>decentralization</em>.</p><p>The proposed model can be summarized as follows. A finite set of economic actors are all inclined to consume or produce a different finite set of goods. This parametrizes their field of visions which need to overlap one another (T1). The state of those actors is described by their variable consumption and production of goods. The state of the latter is their variable price (T2). Their flexibility is parametrized.</p><p>Hayek&rsquo;s main idea is that to reach the equilibrium of the global economy, local actors only need know how to differentiate their local consumption or production of goods</p><p>given the knowledge they have, &ldquo;which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form&rdquo;.</p><p>Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the <em>price mechanism</em> channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives <em>instructions</em>. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones.</p><p>Consumers can act by changing their relative consumption of goods depending on their personal inclinations and the variation of prices. Producters can alter the relative price of commodities depending on their varying capacity to produce them and the evolution of their consumption. The inclination to consume or produce is part of their personal &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, reduced to a set of intrinsic parameters for each actor (T1). The access to the information of prices is also part of this intrinsic &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. Prices channel information between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives instructions if one act so as to maximizes its own interest (T5).</p><p>Alone, an economic actor does not receive the instruction of prices and does act on its state (T4).</p><p>For Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actor and posseses an extensive aspect (more sellers and consumers). For &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to be efficiently used, decentralization (or competition) should be maximized (T6) and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation.</p><p>This very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek&rsquo;s market system is a
<a href=/concept/mechanistic-organization/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/concept/mechanistic-organization/>mechanistic organization</a>. A detailed account for the limitations of similar models in economic can be found in (
<a href=/reference/Koppl2015/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Koppl2015/>Koppl2015</a>) and references therein.</p><a href=#application-to-polanyis-republic-of-science><h2 id=application-to-polanyis-republic-of-science><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Application to Polanyi&rsquo;s Republic of Science</h2></a><p><a href=/note/literature-note-on-Polanyi1962/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/note/literature-note-on-Polanyi1962/>literature note on Polanyi1962</a></p><p>In the Republic of Science, scientists (T5) maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources (T1) — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve.</p><p>When a new article update a scientist&rsquo;s intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the dialogical scientific standards (plausability, scientific value, originality). The first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a <em>dynamical orthodoxy,</em> that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion.</p><p>The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using <em>overlapping neighborhoods</em>.</p><p>The fragmentized <em>scientific opinion</em> is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals.</p><p>The dynamical aspect make sciences <em>traditional</em>: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion.

It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. — (

<a href=/reference/Holton1975/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Holton1975/>Holton1975</a>), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.<br>Physical reductivism defined as the belief that &ldquo;all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics.&rdquo; (
<a href=/reference/Fodor1974/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/reference/Fodor1974/>Fodor1974</a>).
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious.
