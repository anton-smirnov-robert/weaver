What are novelties? Novelties refer
For instance, we know the notes of a new music. We know the colors of a new painting.
We are not surprised by the material composition, as if we were told its composition, we would not be surprised at all.
&ldquo;The painter used a frame of 40x40, the color blue, the chord F#&rdquo;.
Artisitic is a sort of composition of elements. (Poincaré). No material elements is created (due to principles of physics).
However, we can assemble things so that to create something new. What is new, then ?
This is not a mere materialistic assemblage, because we have just stated that no one would be surprise to learn that the artists used this color, make this shape, used this musical pattern, etc.
In fact, given a two dimensionnal shape (let&rsquo;s say square shape), we could actually draw all possible paintings, all photos. Of course, technique of paintings may be important, the texture, etc. Suppose that we can generate any colors on a 4k sceen, and -let&rsquo;s take some advance— we can also generate any &ldquo;texture&rdquo; on this screen. The paintings of Raphaël or just one of all the possible picture we can generate. Does it mean that nobody would no longer draw something new?
There is something strange here, as Bergson pointed out. Is it the same thing to define generically a painting (with material considerations ?)</p><p>Let&rsquo;s now reduce the problem to a more concrete one : the chess game. I&rsquo;m not assuming that chess is an art, but we will be able to understand some crucial aspects with it. I&rsquo;m assuming that the reader knows the principle of the game. How would you play if you were to begin? How did you play the first time? Somebody told you the rules. Each time the turn was yours, you would eventuallly try all possibilities and evaluate if it were good or bad moves. Would you believe someone telling you that you can do new things in chess ? Not really.
How come professional chess players can say that somedy invented something or created a new move? After all, such as for painting, there is no surprise in chess, there is a finite (and particularly low) number of move at each step. All games can be written down by a machine. We can even think of a big book that write all chess games down. How then, could someone dare say that he invented something when there is a book that has already written down its novelty? How does an artist dare to say that it has created a new image when when it is already stored on a large server somewhere? All music have already been produced, on the next server.</p><p>This is because novelty should always be understood with respect to a specific context.
A professional chess player will tell you that, to play, he does not evaluate all moves: he only considers the good ones (at middle of the game).
He does not consider the bad ones. Then he rapidly chooses between the two or three moves that he only considders. You try 20 of them.
Therefore, everything happens as if she was choosing (among three of four move) that are the only viable move, to him.
From all pre-possiblities, she restricted real possiblities by a holistic evaluation of the board.
From where this space of possibilities reduction come from?</p><p>The implicit reduction of possibilities is possible only thanks to a specific context, that can only be understood thanks to the history of the player.
Here, history refers to the training of the chess professional that plays a crucial role in reducing the space of possibilities.
To understand this space of possibilities, you will need to understand the physical individual, how it works in its current environment, but also its history in it environment. Those space of possibilities are therefore highly specific to the individual.</p><p>In fact, in chess, the game is so simple and the moves so restricted that all professional players think about practically the same things. What is a novelty then? A novelty is something outside the implicit space of possibilities, but that can be adopted within. It was therefore a priori excluded and seemed impossible. A novelty is specific to individuals, but if they share and explicit to themselves their similar space of possibilities, they would agree about what is new.</p><p>Does A.I. can be creative? Can A.I. produce a novelty? First, if you give the machine all moves that were done by humans, you will see no novelty. What about supervized learning? We first need to define what is the implicit space of possibilities for a machine. If we understand it as the result that it will return during the learning process, then it will itself produce novelties by trials and errors. Such as a human making a random move on a board and evaluate it afterwards. There is a very thin chance that it discovers a novelty that he will adopts, but after millions of try, it is possible. This is what the A.I. does, however it need rules.</p><p>Chess players find some moves they find interesting in chess games between computers. They are novelties (to them). Therefore, humans, thanks to A.I. can be better at chess, because it opens new possibilities. But, chess is easy because there are explicit mathematical rules. The outcome is &ldquo;winning&rdquo; or not. This is not art. A machine can easily learn how to play perfectly the game. In fact, the pre-possibility space is very small.</p><p>In art, there are no rules and the pre-possibility is so large and outcome so nuanced that machine will never be able to explore possibilities for us. &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; evolve, which means that there are no fixed rules like in physics. How would you define possiblities?</p><p>What does Midjourney do? It generates pictures that ressembles existing ones. It will be able to find patterns that are outside what we thought to be art. For instance, it needs to find shapes, theses are the rules it constructs for itself. It finds rules according to previous pictures and generate something that might be outside what could be thought in our culture. However, art does not reduce to materialistic considerations, can you sum up a piece of art to its materialistic aspect? Of course not and this is what Marcel Duchamp understood. How can you think about something that retrieves a materialistic aspect but is not computable? Numeric images can all be computed, paintings all be drawn. What does it say about our history? What does it say about who we are? We have done everything not to do something. What cannot be generated on a computer or a machine ?</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:var(--primary)}</style><script src=https://weaverbird.net/js/graph.c2737d3ec1f70c1ec909ea32322fcfe8.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/Where-am-I>Where am I?</a></li><li><a href=/About-me>About me</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
