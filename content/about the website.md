To build this website I use several open-source software/plugins. Each one represent a step of my workflow:
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) to reference, annotate documents locally.
- [BibNotes Formatter](https://github.com/stefanopagliari/bibnotes) to import references and PDF quotes/notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- [[Quartz]]
