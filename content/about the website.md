To build this website I use several open-source software/plugins. Each one represent a step of my workflow:
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) to reference, annotate documents locally.
- [BibNotes Formatter](https://github.com/stefanopagliari/bibnotes) to import references and PDF quotes/notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to publish my Obsidian vault and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/templates/) for design refinements. 
- Everything is synchronized on [Github](https://github.com/) that also hosts the webpage. 

I'm very thankful to all the developpers whose work allow this website to exist, especially to [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0).
