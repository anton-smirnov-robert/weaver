I call an organization a system of parts interacting together.
I call mechanism the deterministic process by which an mechanistic organization (MO) is enabled to produce an effect. 
I call machine a physical MO.
I posit 5 necessary conditions for a organization to be qualified as mechanistic: 

C1: The organization has an extrinsic telos.

Physical systems do not have a telos unless they are organized by a designer to do so. In this case, the machine (or more generally the MO) has an *extrinsic* telos. In contrast, biological organism have an instrinsic telos: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence.  

C2: Its parts are generic.

A part of a MO can be replaced by another similar part, leaving the MO invariant with this transformation.

C3: Outside the organization, parts are in a state of inertia. 

For machines, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 
For unphysical objects, a specific argumentation should be given. 

C4: The evolution of the state of its parts follows a law (principle of least action).

For machines, Newton's laws give the trajectory of a physical object when its experiences an external forces. More generally, physics can be understood with respect to a principle of least action, where the action has a precise definition depending on the theory.  
In unphysical cases, a specific deterministic law (relying on minimization/maximization principles) should be given. 

C5: The state of its parts can vary within a predefined sets of possibilities. 

Parts of a mechanistic organization can vary within a predefined (by the designer) set of possibiliites. Within this respect, circular organization (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using negative feedback loops) of the organization. However, in contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties. 

C6: The number of every part follows a minimization/maximization criteria. 

The design of an artefact relies on a minimization principle, the one of using the least possible parts. There are various ways to design machines for a given purpose, and all of them do not require the same number of parts. However, we posit that for a given design, the number of parts is reduced to the minimum when designing an artefact.
However, it is also possible that machines requires the maximum number of a specific part, given *external* constraints. For instance, the maximum number of workers in a field given an amount of ressources or the maximum number of pipettes.
