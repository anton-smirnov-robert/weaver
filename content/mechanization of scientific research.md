Call a system a set of parts interacting together. 
Call an organization a system that is structured for a specific purpose.  
Physical systems do not have a *telos* unless they are organized by a designer to have one, in which case they are machines. 
Call mechanism the deterministic process that a machine realizes, once it has been enabled to do so. 
Call a mechanistic organization (MO) a system that is structured for a specific purpose, where part of not necessaraly made of inert matter. 
A physical mechanistic organization can be called a mechanical organization, a mechanical system, a machine.
I posit 6 necessary conditions for a organization to be qualified as mechanistic: 


C1: The organization has an extrinsic *telos*.

Is said to have an extrinsic *telos* an organization that is designed by subjects that do not belong to the system. For comparaison, unorganized physical systems do not have a *telos* and biological organisms have an instrinsic *telos*: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence.  

C2: Its parts are generic.

Parts are defined such that they can be replaced, leaving the MO invariant by this transformation.

C3: Outside of the organization, parts are in a state of inertia by principle.  

For machines, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 
For unphysical objects, a specific argumentation should be given. 

C4: Within the organisation, the state of parts can vary within a predefined sets of possibilities. 

Within this respect, circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are  homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties. 

C5: Within the organization, the evolution of the state of parts follows a deterministic law (be it on individual part or probability densities).

For machines, Newton's laws give the trajectory of a physical object when its experiences an external forces. More generally, physics can be understood with respect to a principle of least action, where the action has a precise definition depending on the theory.  
In unphysical cases, a specific deterministic law (e.g. relying on minimization/maximization principles) should be given. 




We need to precise the definition of our observable, because we face an ambiguity. Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying amount of ressources. Also, in the case their goal is not binary but unidimensionalized, they can be said to perform more or less efficiently (with respect to those objectives).
In practice, MO are rarely designed to be inefficient. However, taking as observable the most efficient MO for a given task is still too abstract, because we cannot explicit it with certitude. In fact, MOs can complete the same task with or without the resorting to the same mechanism. Therefore, we group MOs by their mechanism, to be understood as its informal description one would give using the pinciple of parsimony (Occam's razor). Now, we define the efficiency of an MO as the ratio of a relevant extensive measure quantifying the realization of the *telos*, and its required amount of ressources. I posit a necessary condition for an MO to be qualified as efficient: 

C6: A efficient mechanistic organisation (eMO) is the most efficient organisation realizing a given mechanism.
