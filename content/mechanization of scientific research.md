Call an organization a system of parts interacting together. Call mechanism the deterministic process by which an mechanistic organization (MO) is enabled to produce an effect. 
Machines are physical MO, built with energy and matter. I posit 6 necessary conditions for a organization to be qualified as mechanistic: 

C1: The organization is open to ressources that enable its mechanism to operate.

For machines, energy and matter are the relevant ressources. This characteristic implies that ressources also refer to the parts of the organization. 

C2: The organization has an extrinsic *telos*.

Physical systems do not have a telos unless they are organized by a designer to do so, in which case they are machines. An organisation designed by subjects that are not part of it is said to have an *extrinsic* telos. In contrast, biological organism have an instrinsic telos: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence.  

C3: Its parts are generic.

A part of a MO can be replaced by another similar part, leaving the MO invariant with this transformation.

C4: The state of its parts can vary within a predefined sets of possibilities. 

Parts of a mechanistic organization can vary within a predefined (by the designer) set of possibilites. Within this respect, circular organization (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using negative feedback loops) of the organization. However, in contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties. 

C5: Outside the organization, parts are inert (they cannot change state). 

For machines, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 
For unphysical objects, a specific argumentation should be given. 

C6: The evolution of the state of its parts follows a law (principle of least action).

For machines, Newton's laws give the trajectory of a physical object when its experiences an external forces. More generally, physics can be understood with respect to a principle of least action, where the action has a precise definition depending on the theory.  
In unphysical cases, a specific deterministic law (e.g. relying on minimization/maximization principles) should be given. 


We need to precise the definition of our observable, because we face an ambiguity. Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying amount of ressources. Also, in the case their goal is not binary but unidimensionalized, they can be said to perform more or less efficiently (with respect to those objectives).
In practice, MO are rarely designed to be inefficient. However, taking as observable the most efficient MO for a given task is still too abstract, because we cannot explicit it with certitude. In fact, MOs can complete the same task with or without the resorting to the same mechanism. Therefore, we group MOs by their mechanism, to be understood as its informal description one would give using the pinciple of parsimony (Occam's razor). Now, we define the efficiency of an MO as the ratio of a relevant extensive measure quantifying the realization of the *telos*, and its required amount of ressources. I posit a necessary condition for an MO to be qualified as efficient: 

C7: A efficient mechanistic organisation (eMO) is the most efficient organisation realizing a given mechanism.
