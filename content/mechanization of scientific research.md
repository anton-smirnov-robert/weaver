## **Abstract**
I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic organization to sniff out Holton's themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polayni's Republic of Science, and an OECD model reconstituated from Science & Technology policy papers are analyzed within that respect. 
I relate some reported issues in the academic community to a mechanization of scientific research, and introduce the concept of *epistemological mismatch*. 


## Definition of a mechanistic organization
Call a system a set of parts interacting together. 
A physical system is a system in which parts are made of inanimate objects. 
A system which has a *telos* is organized, it is an organization. 
An organization has an *extrinsic* *telos* if it is designed by one or several subjects that do not belong to the system.[^1] 
Machines are physical systems with an *extrinsic* *telos*. 

When designers aim to organize a system with the idea of machines in mind, they conceive a mechanistic organizations (MO).
Physical MOs, whose parts are inanimate objects, are machines. 
However, in general, a MO may be designed to organize living beings, notably humans. 
We aim to characterize MOs. 

We posit that MOs are systems having an *extrinsic* *telos* and that are described by the epistemology of mechanics (the branch of physics). 
We give 4 characteristics for a system to be described by the epistemology of mechanics: 

C1: Its parts are generic.

Parts can be replaced, leaving the MO invariant by this transformation.
In mechanics, parts are defined by their generic properties 


C2: Outside of the organization, parts are in a state of inertia.

A principle should be given. 
In mechanics, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 


C3: Parts can vary within a predefined sets of possibilities. 

The predefined set of possibilities should be given[^2].  
In mechanics, phase spaces have this role. 
 
C4: Parts or group of parts minimize their actions. 

A specific deterministic law for parts or should be stated are a minimization (or maximization) principle.
In classical mechanics, the principle of least action gives the geodesic followed by an object.  
Stochasticity process can be formulated. 


There exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying amount of ressources. Also, in the case their goal is not binary but unidimensionalized, they can be said to perform more or less efficiently (with respect to those objectives). In practice, MO are rarely designed to be inefficient. However, naming the most efficient MO for a given task is still too abstract, because we cannot explicit it in general. In fact, MOs can complete the same task using different mechanism. Therefore, we group MOs by their mechanism, to be understood as its informal description using the pinciple of parsimony (Occam's razor). Now, we define the efficiency of an MO as a relevant extensive measure quantifying the realization of the *telos*, given a fixed amount of ressources. 



C6: A productivist mechanistic organisation (pMO) is the most efficient MO realizing a given mechanism. 





**Conclusion and discussion.** 
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines

[^1]: In contrast, biological organisms have an *instrinsic* *telos*: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence. [Mossio2014](reference/Mossio2014.md)
[^2]: Circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties.
