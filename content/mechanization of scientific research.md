Call a system a set of parts interacting together. 
A physical system is a system in which parts are made of inanimate objects. 
A system which has a *telos* is organized, it is an organization. 
An organization has an *extrinsic* *telos* if it is designed by one or several subjects that do not belong to the system.[^1] 
Machines are physical systems with an *extrinsic* *telos*. 

When designers aim to organize a system with the idea of machines in mind, they conceive a mechanistic organizations (MO).
Physical MOs, whose parts are inanimate objects, are machines. 
However, in general, a MO may be designed to organize living beings, notably humans. 
We aim to characterize MOs. 

We posit that MOs are systems described with the epistemology of mechanics (the branch of physics), having an *extrinsic* *telos*. 
We give 4 characteristics for a system to be described by the epistemology of mechanics: 

C1: Its parts are generic.

Parts are defined such that they can be replaced, leaving the MO invariant by this transformation.

C2: Outside of the organization, parts are in a state of inertia by principle.  

For machines, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 
For unphysical objects, a specific argumentation should be given. 

C3: Within the organisation, the state of parts can vary within a predefined sets of possibilities. 

Within this respect, circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are  homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties. 

C4: Within the organization, the evolution of the state of parts follows a deterministic law (be it on probability densities).

For machines, Newton's laws give the trajectory of a physical object when its experiences an external forces. More generally, physics can be understood with respect to a principle of least action, where the action has a precise definition depending on the theory. In unphysical cases, a specific deterministic law (e.g. relying on minimization/maximization principles) should be given. 


Let's dismiss some ambiguities. For a mechanistic organization to work, it needs to be open in some sense (thermodynamically for machines). However, we do not choose this characteristic to be relevant because it does not differentiate MO from other types of organization. However, we call ressources what is outside of the organization but that is required to enable the mechanism to operate. 
Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying amount of ressources. Also, in the case their goal is not binary but unidimensionalized, they can be said to perform more or less efficiently (with respect to those objectives). In practice, MO are rarely designed to be inefficient. However, naming the most efficient MO for a given task is still too abstract, because we cannot explicit it in general. In fact, MOs can complete the same task using different mechanism. Therefore, we group MOs by their mechanism, to be understood as its informal description using the pinciple of parsimony (Occam's razor). Now, we define the efficiency of an MO as a relevant extensive measure quantifying the realization of the *telos*, given a fixed amount of ressources. 

C6: A productivist mechanistic organisation (pMO) is the most efficient MO realizing a given mechanism. 




I posit a definition of a mechanistic organization to detect designers' *themata* related to machines in their proposals to organize living beings. 
F. Hayek's market system, M. Polayni's Republic of Science, and an OECD model reconstituated from policy papers are analyzed within that respect. 
With the help of on recent critics, we argue that empirical issues stem from to those epistemological mismatch. 
Finally, we suggest a distopia. 
After drawing the rapid consequences of such, we finally suggests a distopia that reverse by thematisation of automaticity.
