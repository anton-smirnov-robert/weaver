## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic organization to sniff out Holton's themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polayni's Republic of Science, and an OECD model reconstituated from Science & Technology policy papers are analyzed within that respect. 
I relate some reported issues in the academic community to a mechanization of scientific research, and introduce the concept of *epistemological mismatch*. 

#### Introduction

## Definition of a mechanistic organization

Call a system a set of parts interacting together. A physical system is a system in which parts are made of inanimate objects. A system which has a *telos* is organized and is called an organization. 

When designers aim to organize a system with the idea of machines in mind, they conceive a mechanistic organizations (MO). Physical MOs, whose parts are inanimate objects, are machines. However, in general, a MO may be designed to organize living beings, notably humans. We posit that MOs are systems having an *extrinsic* *telos* and that are described by the epistemology of mechanics (the branch of physics). We give 4 characteristics for a system to be described by the epistemology of mechanics: 

#### C1: Its parts are generic.
Parts can be replaced, leaving the MO invariant by this transformation.
In mechanics, parts are defined by their generic properties 

#### C2: Outside the system, parts are inert. 
A principle should be given. 
In mechanics, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 

#### C3: Parts can vary within a predefined set of possibilities. 
It should be generically or specifically stated[^2].  
In mechanics, phase spaces are the predefined set of possibilities. 
 
#### C4: Parts optimize their actions or collectively obey a deterministic law.
The action of the parts or the deterministic law should be stated.
In classical mechanics, the principle of least action gives the geodesic followed by an object. 
Master equations determine the state of parts collectively. 


THIS IS THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF PHYSICS

#### C5: The organization has an extrinsic telos. 
An organization has an *extrinsic* *telos* if it is designed by one or several subjects that do not belong to the system.[^1] 


#### C6: An optimality criterion exists for the nature of parts and/or the number of parts. 
I argue that when a MO is suggested, the designer refers to the most efficient one for a fixed mechanism. Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying number of parts[^3]. Also, if the realization of the *telos* can be quantified on a line, MOs can fulfill its task more or less satisfactorily. The most efficient MO for a given task is an abstract object, because we cannot explicit it in general (MOs can complete the same task using different mechanism). However, we can gather MOs by their mechanism — to be understood as its informal description using Occam's razor (the pinciple of parsimony) —, and correctly refer to the suggested MO with the suggested criterion, at fixed level of *telos* completion. 


**Conclusion and discussion.** 
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines

[^1]: In contrast, biological organisms have an *instrinsic* *telos*: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence. [Mossio2014](reference/Mossio2014.md)
[^2]: Circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties. 
[^3]: Machines must be thermodynamically open systems to operate. Accordingly, mechanistic organizations must be open in some way for relevant ressources to flow in. Performance of MOs could be evaluated by taking into account the number of parts *and* the amount of required ressources. However, we do not characterize MOs with this aspect because i) it refers to a concept or thermodynamics with brings us outside mechanics ii) openess is not an attribute this is restrictive enough to compare organizations.
