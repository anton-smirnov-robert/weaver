We gives 5 characteristics of a mechanistic organization: 

C1: It has an extrinsic telos.

Let's clarify this point. We distinguish the relations of material entities in three categories depending on their relation to teleology. Physical systems do not have a telos. Artefacts, physical systems that have an extrinsic telos, given by the designer of the artefact. Biological organisms have an instrinsic telos: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence.  

C2: Its parts are inert by principle and their movement follows a principle of least action. 

Specializing to matter, Galileo's posits that isolated objects are immobile in the relevant referential. Newton's laws give the trajectory of this object whe experiencing external forces. More generally, physics can be understood with respect to a principle of least action, where the action has a precise definition depending on the theory.  

C3: Its parts are generic.

To be more precise: a piece of a machine can be replaced by another piece, leaving the machine invariant by this transformation.

C4: The number of every part follows a minimization/maximization criteria. 

The design of an artefact relies on a minimization principle, the one of using the least possible parts. There are various ways to design machines for a given purpose, and all of them do not require the same number of parts. However, we posit that for a given design, the number of parts is reduced to the minimum when designing an artefact.
However, it is also possible that machines requires the maximum number of a specific part, given *external* constraints. For instance, the maximum number of workers in a field given an amount of ressources or the maximum number of pipettes. 

C5: It is not generative and cannot self-determinate (variation is creative ideas, statibilization is organization of peer-review process)
6) Its functionning does not depend on its past.  

9) is not capable of generativity (no self-determination, it cannot act on what it does)
