The dependence between [biological constraint](definition/biological%20constraint.md) can be understood as "repair" or "replacement" mechanisms. It can be slow or fast depending on which one of the *generative* or *dependent* constraint is faster.
Note that there is still no thermodynamic flow between the generative and the dependent constraints.

$$\begin{array}{l}\text { Definition } 2 \text { (Dependence between constraints) Following the above line of rea- } \\ \text { soning, we define a relationship of dependence between constraints as a situation in } \\ \text { which, given two time scales } \tau_{1} \text { and } \tau_{2} \text { considered jointly, we have: } \\ \text { 1. } C_{1} \text { is a constraint at scale } \tau_{1} \text {, } \\
\text { 2. There is an object } C_{2} \text { which at scale } \tau_{2} \text { is a constraint on a process producing aspects } \\ \text { of } C_{1} \text { which are relevant for its role as a constraint at scale } \tau_{1} \text { (i.e. they would not } \\ \text { appear without this process). }\end{array}

>Slow and fast dependence differ in an interesting way. When the dependent constraint is faster, its stability is quite straightforward because something that changes very slowly seems to stand still from the point of view of something faster. In the opposite case, when the dependent constraint is slower (which is actually the case for many chemicals involved in development), then a sustained and stable activity of the faster process is required. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 15)
