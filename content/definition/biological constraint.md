This definition is follows ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md)).


Generally:
- As additional causes, they simplify (or change) the description of the system, and enable an adequate explanation of its behaviour to be provided, an explanation which might otherwise be under-determined or wrongly determined. 
- In describing physical and chemical systems, constraints are usually introduced as external determinations (boundary conditions, parameters, restrictions on the configuration space, etc.), which contribute to determining the behaviour and dynamics of a system, although their existence does not depend on the dynamics on which they act —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 5) 

Specifically: 
- constrains a [biological process](definition/biological%20process.md) at the relevant time scale at which this process occurs. 
- correspond to theoretical symmetries that are local, in the sense of being stable at limited temporal and spatial scales. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 6) 
- refer to entities which, while acting upon these processes, can be said — from the appropriate viewpoint to remain unaffected by them. (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 6) 
- exerts a causal role on the target process. In formal terms, we express this by stating that the situations with or without the constraint are different (asymmetric). This must be true when considering the effects of the constraint rather than its mere presence —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 7) 
- is not altered by (i.e. is conserved through) that process at the scale at which the latter takes place.
- alterations may occur at shorter and/or longer time scales. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 9) 
- does not lead in many cases to new possible behaviours for the constrained process. They are mostly limiting, insofar as they canalise the constrained processes toward a specific outcome from among a set of already possible ones.  —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 10) 
- there is no flow of matter or (free) energy (or any conserved quantity) between the constraint and the process. Rather, constraints canalise and harness a thermodynamic flow, without being subject to that flow.  —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 11) 
- relates to Rosen's efficient regime of causation

Formally :
