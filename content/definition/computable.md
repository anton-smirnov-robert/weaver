Three notions of computability are equivalent: 
- The existence of a [[concept/Turing machine]] computing the function.
- The [[definition/abacus]]-computability.
- A [[definition/recursive function]]. 
A function is computable on a [[concept/Turing machine]] if and only if it is a [[definition/recursive function]].

[[concept/Church-Turing thesis]] assumes that it is the same thing as [[definition/effectively computable]]. 
Some functions are however [[definition/uncomputable]].
