First mentionned in [Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md) to characterize living systems, it is rigourously introduced by [Brillouin1951](reference/Brillouin1951.md) to relate it to the opposite of [entropy](definition/entropy.md) and positively to information (see [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md)). Providing the ad-hoc homogeneity, it reads $$N=-S= I$$
