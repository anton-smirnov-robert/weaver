Represented by the [Santa Fe Institute (SFI)](definition/Santa%20Fe%20Institute%20(SFI).md) or the [ISC-PIF](definition/ISC-PIF.md).
The Nobel Price winner in 1965, Gell-Mann, co-founded the SFI. 
References are Ilya Prigogine, David Ruelle, Mandelbrot, Lorentz, Poincar√©, Hadamard, Stephen Wolfram. 
Their tools are maths, physics, computers. 
Their project is to formalize SHS to make them "exact". 
The majority shares [Gell-Mann's vision of complexity](concept/Gell-Mann's%20vision%20of%20complexity.md). 

We can distinguish two phases: 

**Phase 1** (1984-1995) :
- High mediatic exposure
- objective of a general theory for complex systems 
- Senior fellows (own private banks, margin of academy)

**Phase 2** (1995-2022) :

- Network theory ([Estrada2013](reference/Estrada2013.md))
- Less media, less exposed scientists
