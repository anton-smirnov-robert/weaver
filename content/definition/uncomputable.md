Due to [Cantor's diagonal argument](concept/Cantor's%20diagonal%20argument.md), we know that the set of [[arithmetic function]]s that have a range on positive integers is not an [[enumerable set]]. But the set of [[Turing machine]]s is an [[enumerable set]] because they can be expressed as quadruplets. There are functions are not computable by a [[Turing machine]]. Assuming [[Church-Turing thesis]], they are functions that are not [[effectively computable]]. For instance, solving the [[halting problem]] requires the introduction of the halting function (that takes as argument a Turing machine and a binary string) that is not Turing-computable.
