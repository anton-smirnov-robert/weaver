**Abstract**:  We propose a conceptual and formal characterisation of biological organisation as a closure of constraints. We ﬁrst establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in nonequilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.

As additional causes, they simplify (or change) the description of the system, and enable an adequate explanation of its behaviour to be provided, an explanation which might otherwise be under-determined or wrongly determined. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 5)

>The first condition requires that a constraint exerts a causal role on the target process. In formal terms, we express this by stating that the situations with or without the constraint are different10 (asymmetric). This must be true when considering the effects of the constraint rather than its mere presence11. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 7)

The second condition captures this property by stating that C or, more precisely, those aspects CA !

>Slow and fast dependence differ in an interesting way. When the dependent constraint is faster, its stability is quite straightforward because something that changes very slowly seems to stand still from the point of view of something faster. In the opposite case, when the dependent constraint is slower (which is actually the case for many chemicals involved in development), then a sustained and stable activity of the faster process is required.

>the specificity of biological systems lies in their capacity for self-determination as self-constraint. As discussed above, the central idea is that self-constraint occurs in biological systems in the form of closure, i.e. a causal regime in which a set of mutually dependent constraints act on the flows of energy and matter so as to collectively maintain themselves, and their organisation, over time. In turn, the fundamental formal distinction between the two regimes of causation at work (constraints and processes) relies on the identification of symmetries, and local conservations, at the relevant (temporal) scales. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 25)
