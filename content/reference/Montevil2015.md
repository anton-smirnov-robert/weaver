#### **Biological organisation as closure of constraints**

**Abstract**:  We propose a conceptual and formal characterisation of biological organisation as a closure of constraints. We ﬁrst establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in nonequilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.

As additional causes, they simplify (or change) the description of the system, and enable an adequate explanation of its behaviour to be provided, an explanation which might otherwise be under-determined or wrongly determined. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 5)

>Definition 1 (Constraint) Given a process A ! B (A becomes B), C is a constraint on A ! B, at a specific time scale ⌧ , if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled: I/ The situations A ! B and AC ! BC (i.e. A ! B under the influence of C ) are not, as far as B is concerned, symmetric at a time scale ⌧ . Note CA ! B those aspects of C which play a role in the above asymmetry between A ! B and AC ! BC at time scale ⌧ . II/ A temporal symmetry is associated with all aspects of CA ! B with respect to the process AC ! BC , at time scale ⌧ . —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 7)

>The first condition requires that a constraint exerts a causal role on the target process. In formal terms, we express this by stating that the situations with or without the constraint are different10 (asymmetric). This must be true when considering the effects of the constraint rather than its mere presence11. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 7)

>A constraint, while it changes the way in which a process behaves, is not altered by (i.e. is conserved through) that process at the scale at which the latter takes place. The second condition captures this property by stating that C or, more precisely, those aspects CA ! B by virtue of which the constraint exerts the causal action12 exhibits a symmetry with respect to the process involving A, B and C. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 8)
