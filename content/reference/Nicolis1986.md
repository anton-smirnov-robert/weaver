**Abstract**:  The basic features of dissipative dynamical systems and their impact on the understanding of our natural environment are reviewed. The analysis covers both deterministic and stochastic aspects. Special attention is devoted to the ability of these systems to undergo successive transitions to complex modes of behaviour. The possibility of a unified description of both conservative and dissipative processes is also assessed.
