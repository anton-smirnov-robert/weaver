>We observe entropy decrease towards the past. Does this imply that in the past the world was in a non-generic microstate? I point out an alternative. The subsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small number of quantities, which define a coarse graining. Entropy happens to depends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe depends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low past entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate of the universe) is non-generic. I argue that for any generic microstate of a sufficiently rich system there are always special subsystems defining a coarse graining for which the entropy of the rest is low in one time direction (the “past”) —  (Rovelli, 2017, p. 1)

>The “choice” of macroscopic observables is dictated by the ways the system under consideration couples. The macroscopic observables of the system are those coupled to the exterior (in thermodynamics, those that can be manipulated and measured). The thermodynamics and the statistical mechanics of a system defined by a set of macroscopic observables An describes (objectively) the way the system interacts when coupled to another system via these observables, and the way these observables behave —  (Rovelli, 2017, p. 3)
