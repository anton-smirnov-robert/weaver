#### **Historicity at the heart of biology**     
by Montévil M. (2020)         
*Theory in Biosciences* 141: 165-173       
DOI: 10.1007/s12064-020-00320-8     

**Abstract**:  Most mathematical modeling in biology relies either implicitly or explicitly on the epistemology of physics. The underlying conception is that the historicity of biological objects would not matter to understand a situation here and now, or, at least, historicity would not impact the method of modeling. We analyze that it is not the case with concrete examples. Historicity forces a conceptual reconfiguration where equations no longer play a central role. We argue that all observations depend on objects defined by their historical origin instead of their relations as in physics. Therefore, we propose that biological variations and historicity come first, and regularities are constraints with limited validity in biology. Their proper theoretical and empirical use requires specific rationales.

>==***pb of epistemology***== When physics epistemology is applied to biology, equations are assumed to be permanent while other components of modeling have to accommodate the historical changes of biological objects.

>==***good summary***== Biological objects are not generic because mathematical invariance does not define them. Instead, biological objects are the result of a cascade of changes and continue to produce such changes. In this situation, definitions of biological objects are anchored on specific material objects and the concept that objects have a shared concrete past. In particular, the names of systematics are used universally in biology, and all rely on genealogical concepts—in particular, the concept of a common ancestor. Since all empirical works in biology rely on such names to —  (Montévil, 2020, p. 7)

>==***end good summaary***== define their objects, there is no situation in biology that is defined purely with the epistemology of physics. A measurement relies on a symmetrization, that is to say, a specific way to consider that different organisms are equivalent despite qualitative differences. Symmetrization may be more or less strong; for example, one can study the metabolism or mammals or study the metabolism of a clonal population of cells. However, it is never possible to consider that a symmetrization would be perfect; variations are always possible. Moreover, stronger symmetrizations are not always better. They tend to provide more stable results, but these results may be specific to this symmetrization. —  (Montévil, 2020, p. 7)
