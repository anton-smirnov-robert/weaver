>The current phylogenetic classification of living beings uses the concept of novelty as a way to estimate the genealogical relationship between taxa. For example, phylogenetic trees minimize the number of novelty appearances to maximize the coherency of the classification. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)

>we aim to provide a framework to respond to typical objections by mathematicians and physicists. These objections correspond to the following line of reasoning. We can always define spaces that are large enough to seemingly accommodate every possibility so that there is no need for the concept of new possibility and the concept of possibility is sufficient. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 4)

>Bergson discusses the case of symphonies and states that a symphony is not possible before it becomes real because conceiving the precise possibility of a symphony is equivalent to composing it. However, we point out that one can define the set of all possible music scores as the set of combinations of musical symbols. We show that the confrontation of these two lines of reasoning leads to a paradox. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 4)

>The lack of specific definitions for each real numbers does not prevent mathematical reasoning on them. Instead of reasoning on specific numbers, in most cases, reasoning involves generic properties where numbers appear as generic variables. For example, the statement x2 ≥ 0 is valid for any real number x and this statement is about a generic x. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 6)

>From the viewpoint of mathematical logic, we thus have three different situations for the definition of individual properties: – The set is defined, but not all of its elements can be defined individually within any axiomatic, like in the case of the real numbers. – The set is defined, and all individual elements can be defined in principle. However, any actual discussion can only involve a subset of individual elements because the set is infinite. A paradigmatic example is the set of natural numbers. – The set is finite, and there is no principled limitation. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 7)

>properties to be generic. For example, the force exerted on an object A in free fall is m−g → where −g → is the gravity field, and m is the mass of A. The analysis of free fall does not depend on the individual values of m—being real numbers most individual masses are ineffable—or on the nature of the object. Instead all possible m lead to the same analysis of trajectories. The genericity of the analysis is possible because physics is not about quantities. Instead, physics is based on (generic) relations between quantities. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)

The situation is analogous to the analysis of fractals: fractals look heterogeneous with qualitative patterns at all scales, but all scales are symmetric and a generic analysis is then possible. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 8)

>There are attempts to consider generic properties of a given musical style (usually the style of a specific author or interpret) and then to generate new music scores or soundtracks verifying these generic properties (Pachet and Roy 2014; Papadopoulos et al. 2016). These attempts use machine learning in combination with a few generic criteria that musical patterns are assumed to follow. The aim is to obtain a generic generator of acceptable soundtracks and thus to define and explore sets that have generic regularities that are assumed to be musically relevant. However, these generic regularities are not written in the algorithm, and they are not pre-stated (except for the generic criteria mentioned above). Instead, they are extracted by machine learning. Thus, the individual works of the musician rigorously preexist the definition of the generic properties extracted from machine learning and not the other way around. It follows that these generic sets are specific to the past of an individual composer or style and are subordinated to it. Moreover, assuming that there can be genuine qualitative novelties that result from probing these sets, there is no guaranty that they would be musically interesting. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)

>In physics (and epistemologically similar modeling approaches), the relevant properties are usually generic properties. Physicists understand systems whose states are in enormous sets thanks to these generic properties and not by the specific properties of the individual possibilities (the elements of these sets). In the case of music, the set of possible music scores differs from the set of possible symphonies. For “the musician [to have] a precise and complete idea of the symphony”, she needs at least to consider a possible music score as a possible symphony. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 9)

>Chaotic dynamical systems may have rich dynamics, but, in a precise sense, they are not creating something new. Mathematically, the richness of their patterns stems from the fact that they are digging deeper and deeper into their initial conditions. Their analysis focuses on the way in which the dynamics are transforming the initial conditions, not the specific pattern stemming from a given initial condition. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 10)

>It is not a generic property of the dynamics un to generate a meaningful text. The mathematical analysis of the generic properties of un does not involve the meaning of Bergson’s text. In other terms, the odds to find initial conditions of un that generate Bergson’s text are almost null. It is necessary to have written this text beforehand to choose initial conditions leading un to generate it. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 10)

>we advocate a theoretical notion of possibilities, which we also call explicit possibilities, where possibilities are defined if and only if we define explicitly also how they “work”, that is to say how they take place in an appropriate theoretical framework where they have meaning. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)

>The set of possible music scores has generic properties that are relevant for writing, writing software or printing. These operations are its natural theoretical context. Music scores are used to communicate symphonies as a writing system, which means that they are typically sufficient for constraining the receiver for her to interpret some music scores as symphonies. However, the theoretical construct used to define Ms is not sufficient for a sound theoretical understanding of symphonies themselves. This limitation is not just due to Ms lacking generic constructs. Instead, the meaning of musical possibilities lies at the individual level which means that musical sense is not a generic property. Thus, Ms may only be seen as a set of pre-possibilities for symphonies and not as a set of explicit possibilities. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)

>We call “pre-possibilities” sets whose meaning is not entirely explicit for the intended phenomena. Pre-possibilities are usually possibilities defined in an initial theoretical context6 that are used in another context where they do not meet the criteria of explicit possibilities. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)

>Elements of a set may have the status of pre-possibility for epistemic or objective reasons. Epistemic reasons correspond to a lack of knowledge, typically when the generic definition of pre-possibilities can be completed with other generic constructs that endow them with a satisfying theoretical structure for the intended phenomena. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)

Instead, they involve the integration to an organization, a life cycle and an environment and this integration typically involves a sequence of changes. It justifies that biological novelties are specific even when some aspects of them are generic. As a result, biological changes involve non-generic changes, and we think that the concept of new possibilities is fundamental for biology. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 22)

>Now, a further counter-argument would be to change the definition of S a posteriori so that the new possibility a becomes generic. This objection requires a precise discussion. Let us call S(t) the possibility space at time t. If the observer witnesses a new possibility at time t′ &gt; t, then the possibility space S(t′) is larger than S(t). The operation that we have described in the previous paragraph is retrospectively to consider St′ (t), the space of possibility at time t on the basis of a novelty that appeared between t and t′. Bergson calls conflating St′ (t) and S(t) the retrospective illusion. This illusion may be compared with the situation in usual probabilities. Using the result of a random drawing to describe the initial condition makes it always possible to describe the process as deterministic which is clearly wrong at this level of description. The novelty used to define St′ (t) by comparison with S(t) does not come from the actual behavior at t or before, ex hypothesi. The cost of conflating St′(t) and S(t) is that the definition of St depends on ulterior phenomena and becomes a finalist description: this methodology has a bias towards a specific outcome by excluding many alternative changes which are not taken into account. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 23)
