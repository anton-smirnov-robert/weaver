**Abstract**:  A probabilistic theory for cell differentiation is proposed in which it is postulated that differential gene expression is provoked by random events. An analysis of determinist theories is made, and two predictions based on the probabilistic theory are compared to experimental fact. A probabilistic model of gene regulation is also given. This theory can account for several phenomena: differential gene expression, embryonic mortality, DNA C-value paradox; and it does not need t refer to a wide diversity of specific regulators.
