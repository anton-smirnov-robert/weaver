#### **The Identity of Organisms in Scientific Practice: Integrating Historical and Relational Conceptions**     
by Montévil M., Mossio M. (2020)         
*Frontiers in Physiology* 11: 611       
DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2020.00611     

**Abstract**:  We address the identity of biological organisms at play in experimental and modeling practices. We ﬁrst examine the central tenets of two general conceptions, and we assess their respective strengths and weaknesses. The historical conception, on the one hand, characterizes organisms’ identity by looking at their past, and speciﬁcally at their genealogical connection with a common ancestor. The relational conception, on the other hand, interprets organisms’ identity by referring to a set of distinctive relations between their parts, and between the organism and its environment. While the historical and relational conceptions are understood as opposed and conﬂicting, we submit that they are also fundamentally complementary. Accordingly, we put forward a hybrid conception, in which historical and relational (and more speciﬁcally, organizational) aspects of organisms’ identity sustain and justify each other. Moreover, we argue that organisms’ identity is not only hybrid but also bounded, insofar as the compliance with speciﬁc identity criteria tends to vanish as time passes, especially across generations. We spell out the core conceptual framework of this conception, and we outline an original formal representation. We contend that the hybrid and bounded conception of organisms’ identity suits the epistemological needs of biological practices, particularly with regards to the generalization and reproducibility of experimental results, and the integration of mathematical models with experiments.

>If we use D1 instead of D0, the diagram change corresponds to a change of identity. Alternatively, one may keep the initial identity and justify the articulation between the constraints and χ by the subclass D1 describing a partial closure that includes the constraints explicit in D0. In this case, D0 is complemented by a special case, D1, that justifies the articulation between χ and constraints in D0. This justification does not guarantee that the constraints under study are always functional in D0; however, it guarantees that they are in some cases. We can thus see D1 as an “organizational type” of D0, and write this concept as D0 [D1]. In a given situation, when the constraints involved are largely conserved, we can argue that D1 is representative of most cases, then other situations will be exceptions. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2020, p. 11)

>In a nutshell, a hybrid identity class integrates genealogical aspects represented by χ and relational ones represented by all the constraints. Organisms may violate the relational description in time, which is why the hybrid identity is also bounded. In some cases, as mentioned, the proper justification of such diagrams requires the use of organizational types, which are more restrictive classes than the initial one. —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2020, p. 13)
