**Abstract**:  Darwin introduced the concept that random variation generates new living forms. In this paper, we elaborate on Darwin’s notion of random variation to propose that biological variation should be given the status of a fundamental theoretical principle in biology. We state that biological objects such as organisms are speciﬁc objects. Speciﬁc objects are special in that they are qualitatively diﬀerent from each other. They can undergo unpredictable qualitative changes, some of which are not deﬁned before they happen. We express the principle of variation in terms of symmetry changes, where symmetries underlie the theoretical determination of the object. We contrast the biological situation with the physical situation, where objects are generic (that is, diﬀerent objects can be assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-deﬁned state spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of variation, in particular, biological objects show randomness, historicity and contextuality. We elaborate on the articulation between this principle and the two other principles proposed in this special issue: the principle of default state and the principle of organization.

>==***Test de note***== Variation took a central role in biological reasoning in Darwin’s book The Origin of the Species (1859) in which it served as a means to explain the current diversity of life, by virtue of the concept of “descent with modification” (Darwin, 1859, pp.119-124): organisms might show some differences from their parents, these differences might be heritable and, under some proper conditions, accumulate to form new lineages. —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 2)
