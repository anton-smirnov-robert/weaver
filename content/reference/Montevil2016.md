#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**

**Abstract**:  Darwin introduced the concept that random variation generates new living forms. In this paper, we elaborate on Darwin’s notion of random variation to propose that biological variation should be given the status of a fundamental theoretical principle in biology. We state that biological objects such as organisms are speciﬁc objects. Speciﬁc objects are special in that they are qualitatively diﬀerent from each other. They can undergo unpredictable qualitative changes, some of which are not deﬁned before they happen. We express the principle of variation in terms of symmetry changes, where symmetries underlie the theoretical determination of the object. We contrast the biological situation with the physical situation, where objects are generic (that is, diﬀerent objects can be assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-deﬁned state spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of variation, in particular, biological objects show randomness, historicity and contextuality. We elaborate on the articulation between this principle and the two other principles proposed in this special issue: the principle of default state and the principle of organization.

>==***The principles is inspired by Darwin, Beatty, Gould.***== Importantly, to Darwin, some of these variations would be “chance” variations, that is, changes that would be unrelated to the conditions of existence of the organisms, and even unpredictable (Darwin, 1859, p.p 131, 314)1 —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 2)

>==***For Lamarck, there is no "chance" or random variations. The variations are directed. If they are caused, then it is ahistorical because it can repeat itself.***== This concept of chance variation contrasts sharply with, for instance, the concept of variation of Lamarck (1809) another father of theoretical biology. To Lamarck, variations would be directed by the conditions of existence. This directedness entails that if the conditions of existence re-occur in time, evolution is repeatable and thus, ahistorical (Gould, 2002, p. 191). —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 2)

Elles se font pourtant car ces processus sont les résultats de l'histoire de l'évolution de 3milliards d'années.&nbsp; ( C'est l'anti-entropie qui permet à ces trajectoires très improbables de pourtant se faire). C'est aussi parce qu'elle se font toutes en mêmes temps (closure) qu'elle sont possible.***== The fact that biological organisms are specific objects straightforwardly implies that they are historical objects —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 9)

Pour le bitcoin, il y a un aléatoire quant au mineur qui trouvera la combinaison et gagnera de l'argent en détruisant la planète. On ne peut savoir à l'avance (au sens faible puisque les possibilités peuvent être énumérées si on a une liste constante de miners). Mais le résultat a un moment n'influe pas le résultat d'après. Il y a donc une forme d'historicité au sens faible et fort qui procède d'un hasard faible ou fort ? Non, si les possibilités peuvent être prédites pour les possibles blockchain, elle n'est pas historique.***== Historicity thus goes hand in hand with biological randomness, which corresponds to the fact that a situation after a random event cannot be stated with certainty before the event. —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 9)

>==***We need to explain convergence trends, but strict convergence is. impossible.***== the principle of variation implies that strict evolutionary (or developmental) convergence never occurs: symmetry changes are such that biological objects drift in a burgeoning phase space, and partial convergences always embed hidden differences which may be of importance with regard to the considered behavior of the biological object in that phase space. —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 10)

>==***Coupling between context and history during development, several generations, or longer***== The contextuality of biological objects is coupled with their historicity (Miquel, this issue): biological organizations tend to maintain the effects of former environments and may even internalize their relationship with the environment over time. —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 10)

C'est à dire que le contexte joue tout autant que la molécule signal en soi. Conclusion : la cause n'est pas seulement la molécule mais la molécule + le contexte. Ainsi le contexte joue un rôle.***== These examples show that it is not the molecular specificity of a signal binding to a receptor that determines the response of a cell to a hormone. In contact with a hormone for which it has a receptor, a cell rather responds according to the context of its cellular lineage during development, that is its trajectory in time and space —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 10)

>==***you cannot use probabilities because no predefined space***== the principle of variation posits that unexpected (and unknown) qualitative variation permanently occurs. This means that different organisms are not different realizations of a random variable taken from an underlying single distribution, as this distribution cannot even be defined. —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 12)

>This physicomathematical modeling practice in biology leads to many technical and epistemological problems. For example Boolean networks (see Kauffman, 1993) are used to model gene networks and are defined as random networks where the existence of an edge between two nodes follows a given probability distribution. Such an assumption is a way to model protein or gene networks in an ahistorical manner (and for example to generate them de novo in simulations). —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 12)

>==***ontological and epistemological change***== Last, underpinning our discussion above is the fact that the principle of variation involves two kinds of changes: changes of the biological object itself (philosophers would say this is an ontological change) and changes in the question asked about this object (philosophers would say this is an epistemological change). —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 13)

>The notion of constraint is central to our framework. Constraints are the building blocks of mathematical modeling in biology and are the main objects of experimental investigation. The theoretical notion of constraints that we propose should lead to a reinterpretation of mathematical models that are based on them. In our framework constraints depend on the rest of the organism and the rest of the organism depends on them (principle of organization). Moreover, constraints may undergo unpredictable variations (principle of variation). —  (Montévil et al., 2016, p. 17)
