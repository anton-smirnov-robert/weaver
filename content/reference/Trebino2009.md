#### **How to publish a scientific comment**     
by Trebino R. (2009)

**Abstract**:  You read a journal article that “proves” that your life's work is wrong. Fortunately, you realize that the paper is totally wrong, so you decide to write a comment – the option provided by scientific journals to correct such errors. The procedure for doing this is very simple. You prepare by reading previous comments in the journal, all three pages long. You e-mail the paper's authors, politely asking for key parameters they omitted. Receiving no response, you determine the parameters instead from the authors' graphs. You write and submit your comment.
