#### **What makes biological organisation teleological?**

**Abstract**:  This paper argues that biological organisation can be legitimately conceived of as an intrinsically teleological causal regime. The core of the argument consists in establishing a connection between organisation and teleology through the concept of self-determination: biological organisation determines itself in the sense that the effects of its activity contribute to determine its own conditions of existence. We suggest that not any kind of circular regime realises self-determination, which should be speciﬁcally understood as self-constraint: in biological systems, in particular, selfconstraint takes the form of closure, i.e. a network of mutually dependent constitutive constraints. We then explore the occurrence of intrinsic teleology in the biological domain and beyond. On the one hand, the organisational account might possibly concede that supra-organismal biological systems (as symbioses or ecosystems) could realise closure, and hence be teleological. On the other hand, the realisation of closure beyond the biological realm appears to be highly unlikely. In turn, the occurrence of simpler forms of self-determination remains a controversial issue, in particular with respect to the case of self-organising dissipative systems.

>since the nineteenth century teleology has been replaced by other principles (geodesics, Le Chatelier’s, second law of thermodynamics, attractors...),1 that account for the tendency of physical systems to reach certain stable “goal states”, even under perturbations, without appealing to an inversion of the temporal relation between causes and effects. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 4)

>Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection (Darwin 1859), and Bernard’s notion of conservation of the internal milieu (Bernard 1865). These two pillars of modern biology, although not in opposition, focused on different aspects of biological phenomenology: evolution vs. physiology, history vs. organisation, adaptation vs. adaptivity respectively. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 4)

>Selection does not only explain change in evolutionary history but it also produces adaptations, since organisms are selected for survival and efficient reproduction in a given environment. In particular, the existence of current traits is the consequence of the selection exerted on the effects produced by previous occurrences of the trait. In such a way, selection allows us to consider organisms as designed, and their history as teleological, insofar as the existence of a type of trait can be explained by some of its specific effects or consequences, that have contributed to the adaptation and survival of the organism to which the trait belongs. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 5)

>the evolutionary account actually presupposes the existence of individual organisms that are able to survive and reproduce in their environment. Therefore, it seems to rely on an account of how individual organisms manage to maintain themselves, which as we will see, already involves a teleological dimension. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 6)

>It is worth emphasising that the Kantian account of biological self-determination allows for the possibility of making a straightforward conceptual distinction between three categories of systems: physical systems, which do not possess any teleological dimension; artefacts, which are extrinsically teleological (the telos is provided from the outside, by a designer or a user and does not coincide with their own existence); and organisms, endowed with an intrinsic telos. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 6)

>Homeostasis is a mechanism of stabilisation, which formalises Bernard’s notion of conservation of the internal milieu. As such, it presupposes the existence of the organisation that under certain circumstances it contributes to maintain stable. In particular, homeostasis does not capture the most distinctive generative dimension of biological organisation, i.e. the fact that the components involved in feedback loops are not only stabilised, but produced and maintained by the very organisation to which they belong. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 8)

>The genetic approach, still very influential, combines the evolutionary account with some insights from Bernard’s and Cybernetics’ views,8 and associates selfdetermination with a specific mechanism within the organism: the genome and its expression. The underlying theoretical framework is that of (mainly French) molecular biology, centred on the notion of program (Jacob and Monod 1961; Mayr 1961; Jacob 1970; Monod 1970). In this line of thought, the concept of genetic program, in the context of Darwinian evolution, rehabilitates teleology (Jacob 1970,p.9)as an admissible scientific dimension. The central idea is that teleological behaviours, which control the form, as well as the adaptivity of biological organisms, are subtended by genetic molecular mechanisms.9 In turn, these mechanisms, by enabling the reproduction of the organism, determine the conditions of its own persistence. In this perspective, therefore, the goal is not extrinsic, but rather intrinsic to the system, since it is specified by a program that determines its future states. The program, in turn, has been specified by evolution (Jacob 1970,p.8) —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 8)

>According to them, autopoietic systems are systems without goals. The main target of their criticism of teleology is twofold: on the one hand, the reductive focus of the genetic approach on a specific subsystem (the genome as a program) as the only one responsible for self-determination; on the other hand, the temporal scale of the evolutionary approach, which has no explanatory significance in analysing individual organisms. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 11)

>In our view, Maturana & Varela’s position is inadequate, because it fails to recognise that it is possible to provide a distinct account of biological teleology by relying on the notion of organisational closure. Discarding teleology in toto, indeed, may lead to obscuring the qualitative differences which exist between biological systems and any other kind of natural or artificial systems. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 11)

>At first sight, closure seems to be an adequate tool to grasp the difference with both artefacts and other categories of natural systems: indeed, intuition seems to confirm that it is only in the biological case that the parts exist only insofar as the system does. The parts of a rock do not dissolve if the whole is broken, just as the components of a computer do not disintegrate if the whole machine is disassembled. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 12)

>Rosen naturalises teleology by abstracting closure from time, and by considering a purely relational description of the circular causal regime, and not a dynamical one, based on temporal sequences of states. All subsequent accounts of closure share, we hold, the very same strategy for naturalisation. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 14)

They can be conceived as local and contingent causes, which reduce the degrees of freedom of the dynamics on which they act (Pattee 1973), while remaining conserved (at the time scale which is relevant to describe their causal action) with respect to those dynamics. —  (Mossio et Bich, 2014, p. 15)
