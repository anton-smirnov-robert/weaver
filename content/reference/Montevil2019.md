#### **Measurement in biology is methodized by theory**     
by Montévil M. (2019)         
*Biology & Philosophy* 34: 35       
DOI: 10.1007/s10539-019-9687-x     

**Abstract**:  We characterize access to empirical objects in biology from a theoretical perspective. Unlike objects in current physical theories, biological objects are the result of a history and their variations continue to generate a history. This property is the starting point of our concept of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is relative to a natural history which is shared by the different objects subjected to the measurement and is more or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to considering biological objects as equivalent in a measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by studying objects as similar as possible, while others build on biological diversity.

To an extent, this principle is in line with earlier ideas, in particular, the contingency thesis of Beatty (1995) and the centrality of historicity defended by Gould (2002, chap. 11) in a critical assessment of the work of D’Arcy Thomson. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 2)

Despite its peculiarities, this specimen is still part of the subspecies C. aegagrus hircus because the subspecies is defined by its historical origin —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 4)

>Biological observations typically refer to a specific clade, usually a species or subspecies. By definition of a clade, this only ascertains a given shared theoretical ancestor.

>MMTV is a retrovirus which can be inherited exogenously from the milk of an infected host to another animal, usually its descent (Dudley et al., 2016). If, say, inbred mice are fed milk from contaminated mice of another strain, then these mice will carry MMTV and transmit it to their descent. A contaminated female will lead to a substrain which is genetically identical to the original inbred strain (as long as the retrovirus does not alter mice DNA) but has critical immunological and oncologic differences. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 7)

This adds a constraint, (that will be functional because it wiil be use as a place for eggs, etc.) and you can remove it afterwards. Will it be maintained by fishes ? Is it part of closure ? not sure..***== Performing concrete symmetrization constrains the kind of biological objects studied.

This is what is done to face the reproductibility crisis.However, this means studying more and more singular objects such that the knowledge has a very little power to be practical for another lineage.Reducing life context (removing bad chemicals in labs) is not representative of the outside for instance, such that one studies immuno-deprimed species***== these strategies aim the genericization of biological organizations and use many methods to reduce diversity. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)

In fact, this might mean that a lot of research done in Biology is pointless. In physics, it is not the case because, it is anhistorical. In a way, any knowledge can be used one day. On the other end, for biology, where objects evolve, what is the point of knowing how a mouse is today ? We need to have some stability in time, context, etc. Species disappear.
