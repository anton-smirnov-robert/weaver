#### **Who is Dr. Frankenstein? Or, what Professor Hayek and his friends have done to science**     
by Lazebnik Y. (2018)         
DOI: 10.13133/2532-5876_4_AHEAD1     

**Abstract**:  This commentary suggests that the ongoing malaise of biomedical research results from adopting a doctrine that is incompatible with the principles of creative scientific discovery and thus should be treated as a mental rather than somatic disorder. I overview the progression of the malaise, outline the doctrine and the history of its marriage to science, formulate the diagnosis, justify it by reviewing the symptoms of the malaise, and suggest how to begin to cure the disease.
