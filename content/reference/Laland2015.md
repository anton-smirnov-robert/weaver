**Abstract**:  Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.

>today’s evolutionary theory is vastly more sophisticated than the original synthesis and covers a broader range of phenomena. However, while such progress is undeniable, it does not imply that the underlying conceptual framework allows evolutionary biologists to make the most out of progress in biology and other fields. For instance, some more implicit features of contemporary evolutionary thought, such as the assignment of causal and informational privileges to genes in development, or the treating of development and heredity as separate phenomena, remain prevalent in spite of new data that appear to challenge these assumptions —  (Laland et al., 2015, p. 2)

>We conclude that the EES is not just an extension of the MS but a distinctively different framework for understanding evolution, which, alongside more traditional perspectives, can be put to service constructively within the field. —  (Laland et al., 2015, p. 3)

>It has long been argued that phenotypic accommodation could promote genetic accommodation if environmentally induced phenotypes are subsequently stabilized and fine-tuned across generations by selection of standing genetic variation, previously cryptic genetic variation or newly arising mutations —  (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)

>Consistent with these arguments, plasticity within species has been shown to generate parallel phenotypic differences to those exhibited by closely related species, and ancestral plasticity has been linked to evolutionary divergence among descendant lineages —  (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)

>(i) organisms modify environmental states in non-random ways, thereby imposing a systematic bias on the selection pressures they generate; (ii) ecological inheritance affects the evolutionary dynamics of descendants and contributes to the cross-generational stability of environmental conditions; (iii) acquired characters become evolutionarily significant by modifying selective environments; and (iv) the complementarity of organisms and their environments can be enhanced through niche construction (modifying environments to suit organisms), not just through natural selection —  (Laland et al., 2015, p. 4)
