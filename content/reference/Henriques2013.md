>resistance to the idea of a national policy for science was expressed by the Dutch Minister of Education to the OECD Secretary General, who considered the idea of linking science to economic development as a “prostitution of science —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 2)

>the impact on S&T policies has been different from those applied in other policy areas. This specificity is linked to the role of OECD as a policy innovator enabling the creation, diffusion and institutionalisation of national S&T policies. —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 2)

>Instead of diffusing best practices and tested policies, OECD transformed itself into a policy actor and, in cooperation with a close network of actors constructed a new model for policy-making in S&T —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 3)

>OECD science policy reviews in the 1960s addressed the issue of how, with whom and in which format policy-making in science and technology policy should be implemented by national governments to favour knowledge production and exploitation linked to economic growth. —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 4)

>The existence of a model designed by the OECD for science policy-making was never assumed in the OECD public discourse. No explicit reference to a model can be found in any document. —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 4)

>Two reports were inspirational for the OECD model: the Bush Report (1945), and twenty years later the OECD report coordinated by Piganiol and produced while the OECD action was initiated (1963). —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 5)

>what is here envisaged is not a science ministry or an executive science agency. Science like economics affects all areas of national life and national policy . . . The progress and freedom of science, moreover, have been best served historically in a pluralistic situation, and can suffer when co-ordination becomes control’ (Piganiol et al., 1963, p. 35) —  (Henriques et Larédo, 2013, p. 6)
