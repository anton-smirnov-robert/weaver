**Weaver** (*tisserand*/*tisserin* in French) constitutes an example of an original academic workflow using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 
I use it to organize and access my literature notes using the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method. 
It takes the form of a local [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a colourful graphical interface. 
For an **example**, see the [note on Longo2012](note/note%20on%20Longo2012.md). 
The rest of the website is private, and is of course worthless to you.

Weaver continuously needs work to be maintained, but it is not a goal in itself.
It is like a daily exercise, to get some good understanding of research articles.
This is how I organize myself. I split the entries in **four tags**:
- **definitions**: words that I did not know or common words whose meaning is worth specifying in a given context. 
- **concepts**
- **references** they are automatically generated pages with reference to a document and the commented quotes I highlighted in the PDF document. 
- **notes**: they are most often literature notes, augmented summaries of documents, organized in terms of atomized and linked definitions, concepts, and references. 

At the end of each page, I can access the local graph (with depth 2) around my location.
To get the big picture, I can also zoom or drag nodes on the global graph that contains all entries (click on **Weaver** in the top-left corner of the page). 

To build this website I use several open-source software/plugins. Each one represent a step of my workflow:
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) to reference, annotate documents locally.
- [BibNotes Formatter](https://github.com/stefanopagliari/bibnotes) to import references and PDF quotes/notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to publish my Obsidian vault and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/templates/) for design refinements. Thanks to [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)! 
- Everything is synchronized on [Github](https://github.com/) that also hosts the webpage.
