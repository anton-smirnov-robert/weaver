## Variation and symmetry changes: biology as the domain of specific objects

### Randomness proper to specific objects

### Constraints and specific objects

### Constraints and randomness

### Historicity

### Contextuality

### Variability

### Modelization and specific objects

### Conclusive remarks on the principle of variation

## Bringing organization into the picture

### Organization grounds constraints in specific objects

### The epistemological status of closure under variation

### Relevant variation with respect to closure
