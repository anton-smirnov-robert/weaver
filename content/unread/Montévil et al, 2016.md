## Invariance and symmetries: physics as the domain of generic objects

## Variation and symmetry changes: biology as the domain of specific objects

### Randomness proper to specific objects

### Constraints and specific objects

### Constraints and randomness

### Historicity

### Contextuality

### Variability

### Modelization and specific objects

### Conclusive remarks on the principle of variation

## Bringing organization into the picture

[closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md)

### Organization grounds constraints in specific objects

### The epistemological status of closure under variation

### Relevant variation with respect to closure

### Closure remains closure under variation

## Non-identical iteration of morphogenetic processes

## Conclusions: back to theoretical principles
