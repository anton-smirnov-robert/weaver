Welcome!

You are on my personal website. You can find out [about me](About%20me.md) by clicking on the (colored) bold link.

I built **Weaver** (*tisserand*/*tisserin* in french) to organize and access my literature notes, but also to prompt me to read academic articles/books properly. 
Essentially, this website is the product of my use of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method. It takes the form a local [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a graphical interface. 
It is public to give an example of an original academic workflow, and because I'm thinking about peer-reviewed collaborative work in the future.

This website mostly contain entries related to **theoretical biology**, **epistemology**, and **history and philosophy of science**.
I split the entries in **four tags**:
- **definitions**: words that I did not know or common words whose meaning is worth specifying in a given context. 
- **concepts**: definitions more conceptually involved or concepts that can usually be attributed to a given author.
- **references**: automatically generated pages with reference to a document and the quotes I highlighted in the PDF document. You might find annotations (coming from the PDF) between quotes, don't pay attention to that.
- **notes**: they are augmented summaries of documents, organized in terms of atomized and linked definitions, concepts, and references. 

At the end of each page, you can access the local graph (with depth 2) around your location.
To get the big picture, you can also navigate by drag and zoom on the graph that contains all entries. 
To do so, click on the name of the website in the top-left corner of the page. 
The website is always in construction, but I try to be consistent when deploying online. 
Here are the technical aspects [[about the website]].
