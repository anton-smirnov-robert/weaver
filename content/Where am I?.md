Welcome!

You are on my personal website. You can find out [about me](Anton%20Robert.md) by clicking on the red bold link.

I created **Weaver** (*tisserand*/*tisserin* in French) to organize and access my literature notes using the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method. 
It takes the form of a local [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a nice graphical interface. 
It forces *me* to make (**relatively**) clear sentences and proper notes.
Weaver continuously needs work to be maintained, but it is not a goal in itself.
It is like a daily exercise, for leaving the nest with some understanding of articles.

Weaver constitutes an example of an original academic workflow that can be made with numerical technologies. 
For an **example**, see the [note on Longo2012](note/note%20on%20Longo2012.md). The rest of the website is private, and is worthless to you: make your own!

This is how I organize myself. I split the entries in **four tags**:
- **definitions**: words that I did not know or common words whose meaning is worth specifying in a given context. 
- **concepts**
- **references** they are automatically generated pages with reference to a document and the commented quotes I highlighted in the PDF document. 
- **notes**: they are most often literature notes, augmented summaries of documents, organized in terms of atomized and linked definitions, concepts, and references. 

At the end of each page, I can access the local graph (with depth 2) around my location.
To get the big picture, I can also zoom or drag nodes on the global graph that contains all entries (click on **Weaver** in the top-left corner of the page). 

Here are more technical aspects aspects [[about the website]] or my workflow.
