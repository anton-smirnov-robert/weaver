Welcome!

You are on my personal website. You can find out [about me](about%20me.md) by clicking on the (colored) bold link.

I built [Weaver](/) to organize and access my literature notes, but also to prompt me to read academic articles/books properly. 
Essentially, this website is the product of my use of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method. It takes the form a local [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a graphical interface. 
It is public to give an example of an original academic workflow, and because I'm thinking about peer-reviewed collaborative work in the future.
It is always in construction, but I try to be consistent when deploying online. Here are the technical aspects [[about the website]].

I split the entries in four types (pages are tagged accordingly):

- **definitions**: words that I did not know or common words whose meaning is worth specifying in a given context. 
- **concepts**: definitions more conceptually involved or concepts that can usually be attributed to a given author.
- **references**: automatically generated pages with reference to a document and the quotes I highlighted in the PDF document. 
- notes: 
	- **literature notes**: they are augmented summaries, organized in terms of atomized and linked definitions, concepts, and references. 
	- **other notes**

At the end of each page, you can access the local graph (with depth 2) around your location.
To get the big picture, you can also navigate by drag and zoom on the global graph that contains all entries in the home page. 
The latter can always be accessed by clicking on the name of the website, in the top-left corner of the page. 

As an example, you can check the [lecture note of Longo2012](note/lecture%20note%20of%20Longo2012.md). 

Why did I choose this name? You can take a look at the definition of [weaver](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weaver) (*tisserand* in french).
