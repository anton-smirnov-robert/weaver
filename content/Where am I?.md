Welcome!

You are on my personal website. You can find out [about me](about%20me.md) by clicking on the link.

In fact, this entire website relies on forward and backward links (backlinks) between pages as you can see on the local graph just below. 
At any moment you can go back to the global graph containing all pages by cliking on **complexus** at the top of the page or **Home** at the bottom.

If you are here for the first time, let me introduce you to the project in four steps.
