In 1944, Schrödinger imagine that a “code-script” could be found in “aperiodic crystals” (chromosomes) of living systems ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). Without mentionning “information”, it does refer to a discrete encoding and therefore implies Laplacian determinism (and predictability). This was also acknowledge by the author.
