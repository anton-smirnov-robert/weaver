In 1951, Brilliouin related information and entropy to resolve [Maxwell's demon paradox](concept/Maxwell's%20demon%20paradox.md); more precisely [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md) and the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md). He used the word  [negentropy](definition/negentropy.md) (first used in [Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). Here, it reads **high entropy = low information**.
