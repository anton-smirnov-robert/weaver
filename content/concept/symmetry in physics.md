- Physics uses **generic** objects: objects sharing some common properties (mass, charge, length, etc. ) that can be permutated while leaving the theoretical analysis invariant. This is because physics co-evolved with mathematics, that uses abstract objects. Any abstract object of mass $m$ is generic, because it can be a shoe or an apple for classical mechanics. They are *identical* for a given theory.

- The underlying mathematical equation do not change during the dynamics of the object, because change is to be understand in a somewhat restricted sense, as a change of **the state** of the object (or the system) in a **predefined** space (called "phase space" in physics). The latter fixes the pertinent observables (position, momenta, angle, energy, etc.) and gives all the possibilities in advance. 

- Equations governing the change of state of generic objects are valid in the entire phase space. They are not concerned by the specific values of the object's propreties, but they are rather concerned about the *relations* between the properties of objects. Most physical properties are actually defined in a relational way (charge, mass, friction coefficients, solubility elasticity, etc.). 

- At the core of physical description of matter — objects, phase space, and equations — lies the crucial notion of **symmetry**, which is invariance under transformation. We have seen that generic objects are symmetric for the intended theory. Equations in physics or chemistry are justified using symmetry arguments, such as conservation laws (see Noether's theorem for instance). Physical quantities used to describe phase spaces also consider symmetries to be reduced and pertinent (e.g. Fourier space, etc.).
