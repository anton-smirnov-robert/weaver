In 1865, the monk and botanist Gregor Mendel find that a trait can have different variants (alleles).

He did not used the word "gene", this *basic unit of heredity* was called as such decades later. Molecular genes as sequences of nucleotides in DNA came a hundred years later. 

Mendel suggested three laws:

- Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive.
- Each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.
- Genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes (meiose).
