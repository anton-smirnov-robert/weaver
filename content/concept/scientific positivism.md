It is an empiricism that only considers facts and relations between them in terms of causalities or laws. Science will be able to know everyting in the world.

It prones an inductive view of science (theory based on facts) and not deductive (autonomous theory validated or not by facts).

It is philosophically dated (XIX to  starting-XX):

- facts and theories are co-dependent

- human and social sciences, experiments are not enough
- ontology is necessary in atomic physics (QM, general relativity)
