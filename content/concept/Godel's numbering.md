In 1931, GÃ¶del found a way encode any sentence of a [formal language](concept/formal%20language.md) with a unique natural number. 

He uses the uniqueness of the prime number decomposition. After assigning a number to each letter (or sign) of the alphabet ($n_1,n_2,n_3,...$), a word can be assigned the unique number $w_1=2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3}...$
