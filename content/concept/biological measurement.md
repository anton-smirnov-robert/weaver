There are three aspects of biological measurement: 

- There is a synchronic part of measurements, like in physics. You have generic measurements. 
- There is a control of history by:
1) Genealogy (with phylogenetic considerations)
2) Past and current context
3) Choosing and filtering individuals
- There are still uncontrolled variations, that can be qualitative in top of variability. The "missing case" phenomena.
