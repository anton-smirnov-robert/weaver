Call an organization a system with a *telos*. I posit that a mechanistic organization (MO) is a [mechanistic system](concept/mechanistic%20system.md) with two additional features:

#### T5: The system has a *telos*. 
The *telos* can be given by one or several subjects that belong to the system[^1]. 

#### T6: An optimality criterion exists regarding the system's design 
I argue that when a MO is suggested, the designer refers an "efficient" one for a given mechanism[^3]. At constant satisfaction for the realization of the *telos* and constant mechanism, there exists a criterion regarding the nature, the number, or the disposition of parts or another criterion refering to the *design* process. 

Machines are physical MOs.
