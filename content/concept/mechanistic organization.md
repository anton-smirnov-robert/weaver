Call an organization a system with a *telos*. I posit that a mechanistic organization (MO) is a [mechanistic system](concept/mechanistic%20system.md) with two additional features:

#### T5: The system has a *telos*. 
The *telos* can be given by one or several subjects that belong to the system[^1]. 

#### T6: Parameters can be optimized to acheive the goal more efficiently.
I argue that when a MO is suggested, the designer refers an "efficient" one for a given mechanism[^3]. At constant satisfaction for the realization of the *telos* and constant mechanism, there exists a criterion regarding the nature, the number, or the disposition of parts or another criterion refering to the *design* process. 

Machines are physical MOs. 

[^1]: However, we could argue that MS cannot have an *instrinsic* *telos* — i.e. the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence — like biological organisms do ([Mossio2014](reference/Mossio2014.md)). 
[^2]: Circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations of the parts. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties to adapt to external novelties. 
[^3]: Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying number of parts[^4]. Also, if the realization of the *telos* can be quantified on a line, MOs can fulfill its task more or less satisfactorily. The most efficient MO for a given task is an abstract object, because we cannot explicit it in general (MOs can complete the same task using different mechanism). However, we can gather MOs by their mechanism — to be understood as its informal description using Occam's razor (the pinciple of parsimony) —, and refer to a specific MO in this group. 
[^4]: Machines must be thermodynamically open systems to operate. Accordingly, mechanistic organizations must be open in some way for relevant ressources to flow in. Performance of MOs could be evaluated by taking into account the number of parts *and* the amount of required ressources. However, we do not characterize MOs with this aspect because i) it refers to a concept or thermodynamics with brings us outside mechanics ii) openess is not an attribute this is restrictive enough to compare organizations.
