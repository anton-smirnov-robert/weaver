It constitutes the structure of determination of organisms. 
We talk about organisms using fonctions in biology, like we talk about dynamics of objects using forces in physics.

In the organizational approach, a biological function is a [biological constraint](concept/biological%20constraint.md) subject to a [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md). 
In the etiological theory of functions, heritable traits are selected because of their positive consequences for the viability of the organism ([Godfrey-Smith1994](reference/Godfrey-Smith1994.md), [Millikan1989](reference/Millikan1989.md), [Garson2016](reference/Garson2016.md)). 

The second approach cannot say that the goat that [learns to walk on two legs](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7yu8nw73qUU) has a new function, because it is not heritable ([West-Eberhard2003](reference/West-Eberhard2003.md)).

In both case, there is a need to resort to a larger picture. The second approach need to explain a differential effect (e.g., less rigid and it would have died).
