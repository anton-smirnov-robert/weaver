It constitutes the structure of determination of organisms. 
We talk about organisms using fonctions in biology, like we talk about dynamics of objects using forces in physics.

In the organizational approach, a biological function is a [biological constraint](definition/biological%20constraint.md) subject to a [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md). 
In the selective effect account of functions, heritbale traits are selected because of their positive consequences for the viability of the organism.
