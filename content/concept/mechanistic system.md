A mechanistic system is a set of parts defined by they generic properties. They interact with one another to change their states according to a differential law of evolution. The latter are monitored in a relevant predefined space. 

#### Details : 

Call a system a set of parts interacting together. Call a physical system a system in which parts are made of inanimate objects. Call a mechanistic system (MS) a system organized like a machine. I posit that a MS is a system characterized by four traits:

#### T1: A fixed number of parts is defined by a fixed set of generic parameters.
In mechanics, matter is conserved and parts are defined by their generic relational properties (colour, mass, charge, etc.). 

#### T2: The state of parts is described with a fixed number of variables that belong to a predefined space. 
In mechanics, the state of parts is described by two variables (position and momentum) that constitute a predefined phase space.  

#### T3: Alone, the state of a part is inertial.
A principle should be given or this must be verified. The rationale is that a part alone cannot act to change its own state.
In mechanics, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential in the absence of forces. 

#### T4: The state of parts obey a differential law of evolution.
Either the action of the parts is defined and a variational principle is given, either what makes the state of parts change is given by decomposing (i) the causes of the differential effect or (ii) the integrated effects of each cause. This law must be valid regardless the value of the variables.
In classical mechanics, Newton's law give a differential equation for the trajectory of an object as a sum of forces that are exerted upon it. This can be expressed as a principle of least action. When a deterministic law refer to a probability density, master equations give the differential effects.

T1 to T4 characterize systems described with the epistemology of mechanics (which is a branch of physics). Mechanical systems are physical MSs.
