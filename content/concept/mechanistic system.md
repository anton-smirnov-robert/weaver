Call a system a set of parts interacting together. Call a physical system a system in which parts are made of inanimate objects. Call a mechanistic system (MS) a system organized like a machine. I posit that a MS is a system characterized by four traits:

#### T1: Parts are defined by fixed intrinsic parameters.
In mechanics, parts are defined by their generic relational properties.

#### T2: The state of part is described by generic variables.
In mechanics, parts are defined by their generic relational properties.

#### T3: The number of parts is fixed and their states can vary within a predefined set of possibilities. 
A space in which the state of parts is pertinently measured must be generically or specifically stated[^2].  
In mechanics, phase spaces (position and momenta of parts) predefine a set of possibilities. 

#### T4: Isolated, parts do not change state. 
A principle should be given. 
In mechanics, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential in the absence of forces. 

#### T5: Parts minimize their action, or the evolution of the state of parts (probabilistically) obey a differential deterministic law.
Either the action of the parts is defined and a variational principle is given, either what makes the state of parts change is given by decomposing (i) the causes of the differential effect or (ii) the integrated effects of each cause. 
In classical mechanics, Newton's law give a differential equation for the trajectory of an object as a sum of forces that are exerted upon it. This can be expressed as a principle of least action. When a deterministic law refer to a probability density, master equations give the differential effects.

T1 to T4 characterize systems described with the epistemology of mechanics (which is a branch of physics). Mechanical systems are physical MSs.

[^1]: However, we could argue that MS cannot have an *instrinsic* *telos* — i.e. the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence — like biological organisms do ([Mossio2014](reference/Mossio2014.md)). 
[^2]: Circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations of the parts. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties to adapt to external novelties. 
[^3]: Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying number of parts[^4]. Also, if the realization of the *telos* can be quantified on a line, MOs can fulfill its task more or less satisfactorily. The most efficient MO for a given task is an abstract object, because we cannot explicit it in general (MOs can complete the same task using different mechanism). However, we can gather MOs by their mechanism — to be understood as its informal description using Occam's razor (the pinciple of parsimony) —, and refer to a specific MO in this group. 
[^4]: Machines must be thermodynamically open systems to operate. Accordingly, mechanistic organizations must be open in some way for relevant ressources to flow in. Performance of MOs could be evaluated by taking into account the number of parts *and* the amount of required ressources. However, we do not characterize MOs with this aspect because i) it refers to a concept or thermodynamics with brings us outside mechanics ii) openess is not an attribute this is restrictive enough to compare organizations.
