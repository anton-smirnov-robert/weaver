- Physics uses *generic* objects: objects sharing some common *properties* (mass, charge, length, etc. ) that can be permutated while leaving the theoretical analysis invariant. This is because physics co-evolved with mathematics, that uses *abstract* objects. Any abstract object of mass $m$ is generic, because it can be a shoe or an apple for classical mechanics. They are *identical* for a given theory.

- A mathematical equation governs the dynamics of the *state* of an object in a *predefined* space — called "phase space" in physics — of pertinent observables (e.g., position, momenta, angle, energy, etc.). All possibilities are given in advance, and a *specific* trajectory is merely a partial order indexed by a variable that we can call time.

- Equations governing the change of state of generic objects are valid in the entire phase space. They are not concerned about the specific values of the object's propreties, but about the *relations* between the properties of objects, and their state. Most physical properties are actually defined in a relational way (charge, mass, friction coefficients, solubility, elasticity, etc.), and we can consider that physics rely on a relational, synchronic epistemology.

- Let's sum up, the *specific* trajectory of a *generic* object is given as a partial order on a *predefined* set of possibilities. This phase space fixes the pertinent observables to describe its *state*. Changes are change of state, and they are given by a mathematical equation that is concerned by the differential effect caused by a *relation* between states and *properties* of objects, *for all* possible the predefined states and properties. 

- At the core of this physical description of matter lies the crucial notion of *symmetry*, which is invariance under transformation. First, *generic* objects are symmetric for the intended theory. Second, the objectivity of phase spaces rely on the invariance of the observables by a suitable transformation of the reference frame. Lastly, equations are justified using conservation laws that rely on symmetries (Noether's theorem). 

- In sum, physics understand change (of state of objects) thanks to invariance (under some transformations). Symmetries (for objects, for observables, for time) the use of abstract objects to extend objectivity by stating what is *identical* (objects, experiments, energy/matter).
