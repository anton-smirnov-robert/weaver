Is a cryptocurrency that keeps the history of the transaction (gathered in blocks).
It is based with the aim of removing trust in commercial exchanges. (deshumanize)
You earn money by making computers run on NP-hard problems, for nothing. 
This degrades a lot of energy, for money. 

You need a number to validate a block and add it to the shared block chain. 
Everybody trust computational power, the effort to find a number.
