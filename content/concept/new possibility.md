What matters in biology are [biological function](concept/biological%20function.md).
A function that is a [novelty](concept/novelty.md) is a [biological constraint](concept/biological%20constraint.md) that realises closure,as defined by the [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md). 
We need to say (i) what it constrains (ii) how it is maintained. The novelty not elementary, it can happen in two steps and involves an integration into an organization. It is therefore specific even if some aspects are generic. A novelty can be so deeply part of an organization that it becomes necessary for the organization to be viable. Because it is functional and specific, it opens at least a new possibility.
