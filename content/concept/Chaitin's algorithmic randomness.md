Chaitin suggested that [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) could be considered to be a definition of randomness.

To give an example of a random sequence, he exhibited an uncomputable (see [computability](concept/computability.md)) number (Chaintin's Omega) which is  the probability that a Turing machine halts (see the [halting problem](concept/halting%20problem.md)) reading a randomly generated program (toss a coin to obtain binaries).
