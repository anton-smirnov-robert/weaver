A reference of this theory is in ([Mayr1982](reference/Mayr1982.md)). It combines the Darwinian theory of evolution, [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md), and population-level thinking.

Its core assumptions are :

- ==**The pre-eminence of natural selection**==. The major directing or creative influence in evolution is natural selection, which alone explains why the properties of organisms match the properties of their environments (adaptation).
- ==**Genetic inheritance**==. Genes constitute the only general inheritance system. Acquired characters are not inherited.
- ==**Random genetic variation**==. There is no relationship between the direction in which mutations occur—and hence the supply of phenotypic variants—and the direction that would lead to enhanced fitness.
- ==**Gradualism**==. Evolution via mutations of large effects is unlikely because such mutations have disruptive pleiotropic effects. Phenotypic transitions typically occur through multiple small steps, leading to gradual evolutionary change
- ==**Gene-centred perspective**==. Evolution requires, and is often defined as, change in gene frequencies. Populations evolve through changes in gene frequencies brought about through natural selection, drift, mutation and gene flow
- ==**Macro-evolution**==. Macro-evolutionary patterns are explained by microevolutionary processes of selection, drift, mutation and gene flow
