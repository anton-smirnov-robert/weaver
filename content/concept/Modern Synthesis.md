A reference of this theory is in ([Mayr1982](reference/Mayr1982.md)).

Its core assumption relies on ([Laland2015](reference/Laland2015.md)) :

- ==**The pre-eminence of natural selection**==. The major directing or creative influence in evolution is natural selection, which alone explains why the properties of organisms match the properties of their environments (adaptation).
- ==**Genetic inheritance**==. Genes constitute the only general inheritance system. Acquired characters are not inherited.
- ==**Random genetic variation**==. There is no relationship between the direction in which mutations occur—and hence the supply of phenotypic variants—and the direction that would lead to enhanced fitness.
- ==**Gradualism**==. Evolution via mutations of large effects is unlikely because such mutations have disruptive pleiotropic effects. Phenotypic transitions typically occur through multiple small steps, leading to gradual evolutionary change
- ==**Gene-centred perspective**==. Evolution requires, and is often defined as, change in gene frequencies. Populations evolve through changes in gene frequencies brought about through natural selection, drift, mutation and gene flow
- ==**Macro-evolution**==. Macro-evolutionary patterns are explained by microevolutionary processes of selection, drift, mutation and gene flow

Today's biology is more sophiticated, but there is no new theoretical framework, just accomodations. Without a proper and consistent understanding, approaches to scientific questions can be biased (too much importance on genes, development and heridity are studied separately). 

People have been calling for a new framework : 
[Gilbert1996](reference/Gilbert1996.md),[Noble2014](reference/Noble2014.md))


Insights can be gained from (relatively) new fields of biology:

- ==**evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo")**==
- ==**developmental plasticity**==
- ==**inclusive inheritance**==
- ==**niche construction** ==
