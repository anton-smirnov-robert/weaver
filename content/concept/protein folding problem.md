How does a protein folds ? Levinthal's paradox states that if the protein tries all configurations, it will take forever.  However, it does fold.   [Zwanzig1992](reference/Zwanzig1992.md) “solved” this paradox stating that if there are small kinetical biased along the trajectory of around $k_BT$, then it can fold on biological relevant time scales. 

[Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) makes this problem an NP-hard mathematical problem. It is neverthelelss limited because environmental contributions (solvent, [molecular chaperon](definition/molecular%20chaperon.md), the possibility of multiple conformations) are discovered.
