A demiurge could predict the future with solely position and velocity of all particles in the universe. Laplace states that any [deterministic system](definition/deterministic%20system.md) is therefore predictable. It is false because of [Poincare's unpredictable determinism](concept/Poincare's%20unpredictable%20determinism.md).
