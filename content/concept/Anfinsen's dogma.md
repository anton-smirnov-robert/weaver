It is an postulate for the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). The native structure of proteins in the physiological environement is solely determined by the amino acid sequence.

1) Uniqueness 
2) Stability â€” funnel-like energy landscape. 
3) Kinetical accessibility 

It is challenged by [molecular chaperon](definition/molecular%20chaperon.md), [prion](definition/prion.md)s, multiple native structures observations.
