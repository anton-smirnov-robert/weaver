It is a nonequilibrium open thermodynamical system. In fact we should talk about dissiptive dynamics because open-closeness is in fact defined in the grand canonocal ensemble $(\mu,V,T)$

In this case, it is defined as follows:

Let $M$ be a phase space and a dynamical system $\varphi:M\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M$ such that $\varphi(x,t)$ is the propagation of $x$ later at time $t$. The dynamics is dissipative if it has **wandering points**: points where you do not come back to (which break Poincar√© recurrence theorem).
