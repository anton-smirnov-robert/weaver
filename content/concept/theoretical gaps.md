### On theoretical gaps and changes of perspectives

‚Äùway of understading"

When we face a problem that we struggle to solve, it is common to say that we need to change perspective. 
Roughly, this means starting from a "kludged" new set of acceptable axioms from which we can solve our problem more easily.
When the problem is solved, you usually see the logical path that we could have taken from our first perspective. 
Our problem was that we did not find the pathway in the first case, but it existed.
In fact, there is a lot of chance that your "kludged" new set of acceptable axioms and your initial ones are actually reducible to a common set of axioms. 

However, for more conceptually involved questions, such as scientific ones, you may not find such a pathway when you have solved you problem from a new perspective.
In fact, in mathematics, there are always undecidable statement for a given coherent set of axioms. This means that you need to posit new axioms to find new things. 
Therefore, mathematicians agree on accepting new axioms judging on what they are capable of producing.

This also same happens in physics. You cannot deduce quantum mechanics from the principles and laws of Galileo and Newton. 
It is only a posteriori that you can look at both framework and discuss the nature of their frontiere: are they reducible are not? 
In some cases, theories are not reducible to one another, they do not share the same principles.
Therefore, the frontier shows what I will call a *theoretical gap*.
There are some things that are in-between theoretical frameworks and that you cannot explain at all or solely in two incompatible ways. 
For instance, surfaces between materials are clear-cut in one framework and atomically rough in another. 

Now, this does not mean that we have an incoherent representation of reality, rather incomplete actually.
Reality exists without us, but it will always appear to us, and therefore to our understanding. 
If we agree on having some thin theoretical gaps between our theories, it means that we cannot always continuously advance by gathering data for instance. 
For science to progress, we need to have scientists ready to jump into the unknown to go on the over side and explore. 

Why am saying that ? Because I will now come close to the frontier of the physical continent to contemplate the gap.
This is for not putting axioms that are too far-reached to be conceivved at first. 
This is to avoid **incommensurability**.
