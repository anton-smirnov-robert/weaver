The [entropy](definition/entropy.md) of a **closed system** with **fixed volume** can only increase. 

It is maximum at equilibrium for a system at constant energy. In other words, the system evolves (if not already equilibrated) towards the macro-state that is invariant under the most number of microstates. 

The first law of thermodynamic is the conservation of energy (electric, kinetic, mechanical, chemical,...). The second says that, without external aid, there is a "dispersion of energy" such that it tends to make the distribution of energy homogeneous. 

Originally, this is about thermodynamical cycles (Carnot) and “aid” (for machines):
