Symmetrization is the process of making the biological measurement invariant with respect to the permutation of the organisms under scrutiny.

They are two types of symmetrization: concrete and epistemic.
Concrete one act on material objects (inbreeding) where epistemic one is considering that something is the same (position of foetus does not matter).
Conctrete one constrains the biological phenomena under scrutiny.

There are several ways to symmetrize individuals. The idea is to have a generalizable results. Either you try to obtain to control maximally the history of wild animals to measure some feature (outbred, inbred, in vitro). In this case, you will have knowledge that is very singular, but reproducible. However, those *strategies* are very sensible to the situation of the world that you staged in you laboratory. This certainly is the origin of the reproducibility crisis in biology ([Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md)).

On the other hand, if you do not alter the history of individuals (wild specimens), your result will be less reproducible, but more general in the sense that it is about specimens that you encounter in nature. For instance the field metabolic rate (E1).

However, you can depart from this diagonal. For instance, putting individuals in a specific situations, you can obtain a general insight that is reproducible. The idea is that you have amplified their common caracteristics or diminished their different ones. Another way to do so is by focusing on a case study. You do not aim at reproducibility nor generalization but, you want to show some thing can happen. This is important is our framework, because it can be argued that we need to redefine species
