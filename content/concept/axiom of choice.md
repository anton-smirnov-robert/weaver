The axiom of choice says that you can pick a element from all sets in a finite or infinite collection of sets to form a new set. 
Very often, you don't need because you do have a choice function, a method to pick up the elements (e.g. the smallest element).
Sometimes you don't have this [choice function](definition/choice%20function.md). 
Bertrand Russel has an analogy:

For any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate collection (i.e. set) of shoes; this makes it possible to define a choice function directly. 
For an _infinite_ collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), there is no obvious way to make a function that forms a set out of selecting one sock from each pair, without invoking the axiom of choice


**Formally:** 
For any set _X_ of nonempty sets, there exists a [choice function](definition/choice%20function.md) _f_ that is defined on _X_ and maps each set of _X_ to an element of that set.
