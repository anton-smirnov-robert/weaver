We distinguish to type of sets: 

- A set is an explicit set **if and only if** we define explicitly also how the elements “work”, that is to say how they take place in an appropriate theoretical framework where they have meaning. 

-  A set is a pre-set if its meaning is not entirely explicit for the intended phenomena. Pre-sets are usually set defined in an initial theoretical context that are used in another context where they do not meet the criteria of explicit sets.

When reasoning in a given theoretical context requires discussing specific properties of elements, a generic pre-set cannot be transformed into a generic explicit set. The concept of novelty is here needed. 

In the higher-level framework, the pre-set is fragile since it is not in the adequate theoretical structure. It can change (notations define music but notations can change).

>The set of possible music scores $M_s$ has generic properties that are relevant for writing, writing software or printing. These operations are its natural theoretical context. Music scores are used to communicate symphonies as a writing system, which means that they are typically sufficient for constraining the receiver for her to interpret some music scores as symphonies. However, the theoretical construct used to define Ms is not sufficient for a sound theoretical understanding of symphonies themselves. This limitation is not just due to $M_s$ lacking generic constructs. Instead, the meaning of musical possibilities lies at the individual level which means that musical sense is not a generic property. Thus, $M_s$ may only be seen as a set of pre-possibilities for symphonies and not as a set of explicit possibilities. —  (Montévil, 2019, p. 11)
