Three notions of computability are equivalent: 
- The existence of a [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md) computing the function.
- The [abacus](definition/abacus.md)-computability.
- A [recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)

A function is computable on a [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md) if and only if it is a [recursive function](definition/recursive%20function.md)

[Church-Turing thesis](concept/Church-Turing%20thesis.md) assumes that it is the same thing as [effectively computable](definition/effectively%20computable.md).
Some functions are however [uncomputable](definition/uncomputable.md).
