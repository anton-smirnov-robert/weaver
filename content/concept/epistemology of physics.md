Physics uses *generic* objects. They are abstract objects sharing some common *properties* (mass, charge, length, etc. ), and that can be permutated while leaving the scientific rationale invariant. For instance, any abstract object of a mass $m$ is generic, because a shoe and an apple with the same mass are *identical* from the point of view of free fall in classical mechanics.

A mathematical equation governs the dynamics of the *state* of an object in a *predefined* space of pertinent observables (e.g., position, momenta, angle, etc.) called *phase space*. All possibilities are given in advance, and a trajectory is only a partial order indexed by a variable that we call time. Equations are valid in the entire phase space. Therefore, equations are not concerned about the specific values of the object's state or propreties, but rather about the *relations* between those quantities. Most physical properties are actually defined in a relational way (charge, mass, solubility, elasticity, etc.), and we can consider that physics rely on a relational epistemology.

At the core of this physical description of matter lies the cental notion of symmetry, which is invariance under transformation. First, generic objects are symmetric, because they can be permutated while leaving the scientific explanation invariant. Second, the objectivity of phase spaces rely on the invariance of the observables by a suitable transformation of a reference. For instance, Galilean referentials are useful because the dynamics studied in one of them are also valid in others. Lastly, equations are justified using conservation laws that can be linked to  symmetries (Noether's theorem). Fundamentals laws of physics, such as the conservation of energy in mechanics, stem from a time-reversal symmetry. 

In sum, physics understands change (of state of objects) based on invariance (under some transformations). Symmetries are central (for objects, for observables, for time) to extend objectivity by stating what is *identical* (objects, experiments, energy). The trajectory of the state a *generic* object is given as a partial order on a set of pertinent possibilities. It is given by a mathematical equation that is concerned by the differential effect caused by a relation between states and properties of objects, for all possible values defined by the predefined phase space.
