This *informal notion* also refers to: 
- a procedure 
- a paper-and-pencil method or 
- to a mechanical method 

It is specific to a type of problem but we can state:

- A finite number of instructions.
- It always terminates after a finite number of steps.
- It always produces a correct answer.
- It can be done by a human without any aids except writing materials.
- Its instructions need only to be followed rigorously to succeed : it requires no ingenuity
