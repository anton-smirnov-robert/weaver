What happen if a purely liberal model of science — building on the invisible hand picture "that guides scientists towards an unknown direction" — is hijacked by centralizing science coordination and planning towards a precise goal? This question is interesting, but a better one is: what happens if this pardoxal situation is now given to neoliberals? Should they follow the ideas of their founding fathers or is the ability to push science towards a direction too tempting? 

Some aspects are retained or slightly modified: 

1) Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. 
2) International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs.

Some aspects are transformed: 

1) The linear model is no longer valid, there is some "tacit knowledge" (another idea of Polanyi) that cannot be transferred in the linear model of innovation. For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (reasearcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. 
2) The state should no longer plan science. It should follow what "stakeholders" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain. 

Advices:

1) The governement should be commited to stakeholders, show implication to send them good signals. It should be flexible because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to conntextual evolutions...
2) "Mission-oriented" policies should be designed to solve grand societal challenges. Two birds on stone because "their awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause is an incentive for surpassing oneself". Examples are given: nuclear energy, conquest of space.  The ideology of all scientists is fixed. For instance, all scientists are for nuclear energy, all scientists do believe that we shoudl conquer space. Is there an ideological engagement when making research ?  
3) Subjects of "mission-oriented" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality. 

The market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want.  

In any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV? (such as the meaning of "islamo-gauchism"). *The scientific activity is against the doxa.* 

The role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented. It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal.
