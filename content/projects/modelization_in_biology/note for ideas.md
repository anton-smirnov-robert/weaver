"Fibonacci's Garden: Reflecting on the Application of Mathematics and Big Data in the Life Sciences" is an illuminating philosophy book that navigates the intricate maze between ==mathematics and the life sciences==. With an emphasis on ==philosophical contemplation==, the authors delve into the ==beauty and potential pitfalls of intertwining mathematical models with the complex world of biological systems==.  
  
Big data's triumphs and tribulations form a crucial pathway in this garden. ==The authors discuss the staggering possibilities that algorithms, data mining, and predictive analytics bring to bioinformatics and personalized medicine==. However, the book also takes an unflinching look at the thorny issues surrounding data privacy, biases, quality, and the unintended consequences of uncritical reliance on data as week as analysis how society needs to react to issues concerning the rising use of such methods, developing notions like statistical and data literacy. Recent scholarship warns about the ==increasing use of mathematical techniques in order to prescribe policies and produce knowledge under a veil of neutrality==, and argues that we should carefully evaluate the consequences of these techniques in science and society. This volume aims at contributing to this literature without an over fatalistic perspective that missed the chances and opportunities.  
  
The readers are encouraged to ==ponder the chances and risks that come with wielding mathematical tools in life sciences and to be vigilant of potential manipulations and misapplications== that can distort scientific integrity or affect societal values.  
  
"Fibonacci's Garden" further addresses the importance of ==questioning assumptions behind mathematical models in general and critically assessing their applicability to biological systems in particular==. This is in particular important when the quality of life of real people depend on the scientific research. In doing so this is also ==a study of applied mathematics in general and contributes to the study of mathematical and scientific practices==.  
  
This book is ideal for philosophers (of science), mathematicians, biologists, ethicists, and intellectually curious minds.

Ideas: 
- Contemplation: Look rather than trying to think abstractly about it. Like in drawing: force you not to imagine what this *should* be like, but I it is. 
- *Organizing data and facts in knowledge that make sense*, rather that to describe organisms: pharmakology of techniques in Science. 
- politiser l'épistémologie.
- Use of mathematical models in biology — the case of Biophysics (deconstruction). Simulation vs Understanding.  
- Writing: enshrined in the alphabetical writing (Leroy-Gourhan).  


From Maël and co: 
- History (of Darwin) is first. Physics understand biology, based on invariances. If species evolve, they must do the same at the microscopic scale --> timescale. 
- Genericity and abstraction (shared properties, which are few). Comes from the maths (anhistoric and decontextualis). 




Abstraction, genericity, writings --- Matter, complexity, specificity.
