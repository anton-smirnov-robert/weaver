### What is identity? Why defining it?

The concept identity for organisms can be more or less restricted. The largest is *individuation*, which is having the propreties drawing its own boundaries and discriminating itself from the surrounding.  All organisms fall into the same reference class if identity is defined as such. The narrowest is *unicity*, i.e. having the exactly the same set the properties. They each reference class as one element. In practice we want somehting in between, but it depends on what we want. In the following, the purpose is to do experiments and model organisms.

In experimental biology, [symmetrization](concept/symmetrization.md) is the process of (concretely of epistemically) positing a reference class in experimental practices (see [note on Montevil2019](note/note%20on%20Montevil2019.md)). However, it is not sufficient because you do not control how many variations occured before your last control.
