[The Republic of Science](note/The%20Republic%20of%20Science.md)

Michael Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Michael was first of all a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a close friend of Hayek. In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek. Let's understand why. 

Polanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. This metaphor comes with a cumulative view of knowledge that we will endorse here: discoveries are made when you work hard enough to unturn stones. This implies a space of potential discoveries in which some of them have already been made. (see Fig.1) 

The state of explorers can be defined on the frontier of the known discoveries subspace. Indeed, researchers maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, when a new discovery is made, an explorer adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the *scientific standards:

1. Plausibility
2. Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.
3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists

Scientific standards associate two complementary and antagonistic logics: stability and variation (or "conformism" and "dissent"). This duality shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority that encourages its subversion. This aspect make sciences historical because the scientific opinion change throughtout time and therefore so does the interpretation of the scientific standards by researchers. This prevents a differential law of evolution to be valid once for all. The shape of the puzzle change throughout time and this constraints the directions explorers look at. 

The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists (or "overlapping neighborhoods") allow them to enforce the authority of the scientific standards when articles are submitted, by the peer-review process. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals that endorse each other. 

While Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchange of information between scientists is made by scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey instructions to reach a known goal. Explorers don't need discoveries to work per se — they give them a better directions to look at — so they are not inert when left alone.

>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)
