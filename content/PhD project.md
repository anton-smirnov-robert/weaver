# Methods and epistemological limits of an organicist biology


#### Abstract

This project aims to bring to fruition a theoretical framework that posits non-mechanistic principles for understanding organisms. It proposes to elaborate methods, know-how and generally applicable guidelines that will allow biologists to make these concepts their own, and use them in practice to generate new knowledge. The epistemological question regards the types of knowledge that one can generate with models stemming from theories that emphasize, for example, the irreducible unpredictability of the variation of organisms or the specific circularity of their organization. Oscillating between modeling and critical reflexivity, this work will mature thanks to methodological experiments that will be the object of scientific publications, and thanks to discussions with several epistemologists concerning the difficulties (inherent or accidental) encountered along the way. By contributing to the understanding of viable organizational modes of material and functional entities, this interdisciplinary work also grounds relevant concepts to think/heal (_pænser_) the Anthropocene.

#### Context

The Anthropocene is a symptom, at least in part, of a mechanistic view of life. This philosophy (symbolized by the founding thought of Descartes) is today strongly criticized, but biology is slowly moving forward. It is indeed common to hear that we need to “change our relationship with living beings”, rarely that we need new theories in biology. However, in 1913, Radl already noted that a scientist who feels that he belongs to nature and who does not stand before it as before foreign phenomena, is a vitalist—not a mechanist [Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md) The proximity of contemporary ecological debates to the history of biology should invite us to an epistemological reflection on our current practices. Should we not be alarmed that a theory allows, in 2020, the awarding of the Nobel Prize to someone claiming one can “reprogram” life or “control evolution” ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md),[Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md))? Does this lack of rigor not lead to disastrous political choices—like the Genetic Technology Bill nowadays?

Dismissing mechanism—and its contributions to biology—too quickly would amount to making the same mistake, the one of forgetting the history of science. The excesses of this philosophy are not peculiar to our time, they have been appearing with more or less insistence for several centuries, so that for Canguilhem, vitalism would embody “the permanent mistrust of life in front of the mechanization of life”([Canguilhem1992a](reference/Canguilhem1992a.md)). Nevertheless, the omnipresence of interconnected digital artifacts forces us today to deeply rethink the terms of this debate and its stakes. Vaucanson's duck has been digitalized with the central dogma of molecular biology ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md)), and any sufficiently “intelligent” algorithm takes shape in a hardware to which we too easily lend life ([Roli2022](reference/Roli2022.md)).

In science, this dialectic of the organism and the machine is revealed in the mathematical models used to describe the living. Although many people rightfully refuse to assimilate an organism to a machine, most studies carried out in biology resort to the epistemology of physics. For example, one encounters the notion of noise (for measurement), the notion of equilibrium (Hardy-Weinberg), the transfer of information (central dogma of molecular biology), a unimodal probability distribution for allele frequencies (which institutes a deviation from a mean), gene networks described on predefined topologies (Waddington), optimizations to describe morphologies (fractals, surface/volume ratio, etc.), a diversity of programs (genomes) selected by external forces (environment). By using methods adapted to inert matter, we learn about the constituents of a being, about the physico-chemical processes that constitute it, but we do not talk about organisms (bio-_logos_, talking about the living). So, can we properly model organisms? With our machines? How ([Glade2022](reference/Glade2022.md))?

These questions are not unrelated to the current instabilities of the theoretical framework of biology. The models described above are ways of making it sensible, and thus reveal the physicalist reductionism that underlies it — which posits that _theories_ in biology must be reducible to the ones of physics. The recognition of the influences of development and plasticity of organisms on evolution has challenged the neo-Darwinian approach ([West-Eberhard2003](reference/West-Eberhard2003.md)). Synthetic evolutionary theory, in its extended version ([Laland2015](reference/Laland2015.md)), recognizes non-genetic transmissions, the emergence of phenotypic novelties, the possibility for an organism to modify its environment, and other complexities for understanding the biosphere. Nevertheless, in regaining its validity, this extension hardly provides new fruitful methods. Rather, it weakens itself by tolerating observations that contradict the principles that constitute its core. For a theory to keep its internal coherence while retaining deductive power, it needs rigorous, exploitable and generative principles, that is to say, principles that posit necessities and not possibilities.

A long organicist tradition has seen Claude Bernard, Jean Piaget, or even Francisco Varela try to rigorously define what, in the 18th century, Immanuel Kant had defined as an entity capable of self-organization. Recently, a formal definition grounded in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and bringing together the efforts of the last decades, has been proposed ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md), [Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md)). This work is part of a broader scientific adventure that aims to push the frontiers of biology in new directions ([Bailly2011](reference/Bailly2011.md),[Noble2015](reference/Noble2015.md), [Soto2016](reference/Soto2016.md),[Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md))—beyond the paradigm that conceives of living beings by analogy with machines. Thus, three principles have been posited to describe an organism ([Soto2016](reference/Soto2016.md)). They result from an important epistemological reflection to distinguish biology from physics (or integrate the latter as a singularity into the former). As a reminder, physics studies the changes of the state of a system in a predefined space, on the basis of invariants and symmetries. This discipline is interested in the relations between generic properties of objects (mass, charge, size, etc.).

The _principle of variation_ posits that biological organisms are specific, that is, the mathematical structure necessary to describe them varies over time in a fundamentally unpredictable way. Since variations relevant in biology are functional, this principle implies that describing an object of study requires talking about its _history_ and _context_, which are unique.

In parallel to Galileo's principle of inertia, _the default state principle of cells_ is posited: they are motile, and proliferate (with variation according to the first principle, because cells are different from one another). The causes that must be explained by the biological theory are, as in physics, the deviations from the state of inertia. However, we are no longer looking for external forces acting on an object to set it in motion, but for the constraints that act on the cellular default state. We must explain reduced mobility, absence or excess of proliferation, but not motility or proliferation per se.

The _principle of organization_ emerges from the work that formalizes Kant's idea, as mentioned above. It postulates that organisms are organized in the sense that they realize the _closure of constraint_, where the crucial concepts of biological processes, constraints and functions are rigorously defined. This notion provides theoretical roots for the notion of biological autonomy ([Moreno2015](reference/Moreno2015.md)).

The changes for science are major, as the regularities of a system are no longer explained by appealing to the regularity of its constituent parts (and their interactions). In this new paradigm, the parts of the system vary intrinsically, and the stability of the system comes from its circular organization. This is an ontological shift (for the living) that opens up truly new and relevant paths. Epistemology, theories, and modeling in biology cannot be reduced to those of physics.

More recently, the successive articulations of these principles have led to several concepts. First, the concept of anti-entropy which mobilizes the historicity of organisms ([Montevil2022a](reference/Montevil2022a.md)) and the closure of constraint. Second, the concept of anti-entropy production integrates the notion of novelty with the principle of organization ([Montevil2019a](reference/Montevil2019a.md)). These two concepts, which thus raise the question of biological time (past for history or future for novelties), are also fruitful for rigorously theorizing the concept of disruption in biology ([Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)).

Finally, those concepts, that emerge from theoretical biology, allow us to understand some systemic problems of the Anthropocene ([Montevil2021a](reference/Montevil2021a.md)). Briefly, according to Bernard Stielger and the Internation collective, this period can be characterized by a temporal lag between a technical system and the knowledge necessary for its individual and social appropriation. Thus, the degradation of the biosphere by technologies requires an in-depth rethinking of the functioning of our exosomatic organs ([Lotka1945](reference/Lotka1945.md), [Canguilhem1992b](reference/Canguilhem1992b.md)). Integrating the technosphere into the biosphere requires the ability to describe viable organizational modes of biological and economic processes, i.e., those that resist the degradation of time, i.e., that resist entropy ([Stiegler2021](reference/Stiegler2021.md)). The stakes of an organicist theoretical biology, or more particularly of an organology, are not only epistemic ones, and they have the potential to make a difference in facing today's biosphere crisis.

#### Question and goal of the project

For this epistemological and theoretical adventure to bear fruit, the work carried out must be put into the hands of biologists with methods. A method is not a mechanical protocol, but a know-how that allows biologist-artisans to appropriate and use in practice theories to generate new knowledge. It is shared by establishing generally applicable guidelines; these are strategies to be interpreted more or less freely, not programs.

The stakes of this project are not only operational, because it is not obvious that an organicist biology can be so! In an organism, unlike a machine, the existence of its constituents depends on the functioning of the whole. Its parts cannot be isolated, its circularity prevents non-intrusive analysis. Moreover, what can the biologist say in front of novelties, unpredictable by definition? René Thom said, in a clear-sighted burst of physico-mathematician intellectual honesty, that Darwin's theory was not scientific, because the possibilities of evolution were not predefined. The question that underlies the project is then: what kind of knowledge can an organicist biology generate about living beings? The best way to answer this question is to develop a method and discuss its epistemic contributions. We will discuss the nature of the obstacles we encounter in dialogue with relevant thinkers and clarify the modeling difficulties that are intrinsic to an organicist biology.

Pragmatically, as an example, a part of physics instantiate its theories by a method that consists in identifying invariants (symmetries, conservation law, etc.) to give a differential equation, specifying initial and boundary conditions, then solving analytically or numerically the problem. The work I propose aims to develop an equivalent for biology studies, based on the principles mentioned above.

#### How?

“Methods come at the end” according to Nietzsche. Indeed, it is necessary to model and experiment to take a critical look, then to pose general and shareable strategies. Our main contribution will therefore only be written after three years, but it requires methodological experiments (and therefore scientific productions) to do so.

Today, most biological models use the tools of physics or statistics to interpret empirical or computationally generated data. In contrast to this inductive approach, the proposed models will have to proceed from the theoretical framework ([Glade2022](reference/Glade2022.md)). This work will necessarily see the emergence of novelties in terms of know-how, beyond a simple combination or arrangement of practices used in biophysics. Some promising initial attempts have been made ([Montevil2016b](reference/Montevil2016b.md), [Bich2020](reference/Bich2020.md), [Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). They are examples of the modeling work we need to do and _then_ generalize to provide transferable guidelines. Discussions and collaborations with the authors of these papers are expected, especially with Matteo Mossio and Leonardo Bich. Before undertaking these efforts, a solid grasp of the theoretical concepts is necessary, as well as a fine appreciation of the epistemological issues involved in modeling in theoretical biology ([Glade2015](reference/Glade2015.md)). Potential collaborators, such as Franck Varenne, can contribute to guide the research, or participate in the epistemological discussion regarding the insights brought by the elaborated methods ([Varenne2013](reference/Varenne2013.md)).

Let us say a little more about the work that will be carried out. The closure of constraint has a valuable diagrammatic representation on which other concepts specific to organisms can be grammaticalized ([Montevil2020a](reference/Montevil2020a.md)). This will be a starting point. It seems that we can distinguish three stages in our future work. First, we will need to understand to what extent the closure of constraint enriches the modeling of biological phenomena ([Bich2020](reference/Bich2020.md)). Can one assemble partial models coming from biophysics to describe the whole organism? What does the organicist view bring to the modeling of the parts? Can we obtain quantitative models? Can the self-determination (in the form of self-constraint) of an organism be numerically implemented? Concrete applications will be produced, criticized and compared to be generalized.

The incorporation of the historicity of organs into the modeling of organisms is the second Gordian knot of the project. While physics is based on a relational epistemology, biology must integrate the historicity of organisms to define them. Articulated with the principle of organization, the concept of anti-entropy comes into play. Experimentally, new practices have been prescribed ([Montevil2019](reference/Montevil2019.md)), but it is also necessary to introduce a phylogenetic and ontogenetic history into the modeling of the functions of an organism.

Finally, the concept of anti-entropy production refers to the change in the space of relevant observables to describe the living system ([Montevil2022](reference/Montevil2022.md)). Unpredictable functional variations allow new possibilities and project the organism into a new space of description. The question of temporality will be central here, because the continuous physical time is no longer the relevant observable. The irreducible duration of cycles in the life of organisms (heartbeat, breathing, day, seasons, etc.) prevent laws of evolution based on infinitesimal differentials of time. What can a scientific method tell when it chooses to speak of unpredictable novelties in a conceivable space, rather than meaningless states in a fundamentally non-ergodic system? How can digital machines help the elaboration of an organicist biological modeling practice?
