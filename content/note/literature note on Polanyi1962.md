## **The Republic of science**     
by Polanyi M. (1962)         
*Minerva* 1: 54-73       
DOI: 10.1007/BF01101453

#### Background

Micheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. His concept of *tacit knowledge* will be used by the OECD later. 

In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. 


##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. 
Polanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1].

While Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).

##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards
However, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:

1.  Plausibility
2.  Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.
3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists

##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves
The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. 

##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science
Moreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too.

>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  


#### Comments

- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.
- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.
- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2].

>Neoliberalism was not the dominant ideology in the Western world at that time. The Republic of Science is more related to a liberal view of science, in the classical view, without state intervention. Sixty years later, we find an era of neoliberalism in science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)), but this has nothing to do with what is suggested here. 

- Idea of enablement. 

[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.
[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.
