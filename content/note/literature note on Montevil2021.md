#### **Computational empiricism : the reigning épistémè of the sciences**     
by Montevil M. (2021)         

**Abstract**:  What do mainstream scientists acknowledge as original scientific contributions? In other words, what is the current épistémè in natural sciences? This essay attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical, generating data and computational, to analyze them and reproduce them with models. This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.

### Summary

#### The IMRaD structure is about contextualizing a single unbiased observation to transform it to knowledge.
It is like adding a single brick on the cathedral of knowledge. The separation of results and discussion means that your mind is a virgin receptacle for information to flow inside. Then, you analyze the results that you have unbiasly seen. With the IMRaD format, scientists exchange information without being transformed (receptor, receiver). This is not theoretial thinking since the latter change how we think about phenomena. In fact, scientists do not have time to engage with specific ways to organize scientific rationality.

#### Experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world, that is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from an interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon

There is a confusion between objectivity and automation. You can make something automatic with a deep unoticed theoretical commitment.

#### The current épistémè still has a positivist influence
The scientific aim in the current épistémè is to find causal patterns or "mechanisms". Case studies or not considered, but they can give useful insights: the existence of one planet, the fact that something is possible, etc. The kind of knowledge that is looked for points to [[scientific positivism]]. The épistémè builds on induction and is a kind of empiricism.

#### Review articles contrast with original research in the current épistémè, except when statistical meta-analysis are performed
As review articles are typically required to be critical, the computational statistical analysis seems to considered more original then subjective critics. Review articles are requested by editors, which are often not researchers. With the massification and acceleration of scientific production, synthetic works should be valuable. They are not. However, theorization has a synthetic function.

#### Modelling is specific to a phenomena, is not theoretical work and need to be included in a theoretical framework
However, like in Planck's quanta case, it can be the starting point for a broader general framework. Most models are mathematical (and computational). They aim to imitate several properties with precision. Theoretical work confers a profound scientific meaning to the properties of models (Planck's quanta). Mathematical modelling is not theoretical work when it is local. When it results from a theoretical move, with original mathematical tools, it is then a part of theoritization. For instance, mathematical tools that originate from physics and transferred to biology convey implicit considerations. Models need to be included in a theoretical framework.

#### Computational empiricism focuses on empirical data and mechanized computations
It cares for numerical questions but do not attend for its logoi. Original works are empirical, generating data to analyze and reproducing them with models. In empirical works, the approach is inductive although statistical Popperian tests are usually conducted. In computational models, the ability to fit empirical data prevail on theoretical consistency or significance.


#### The épistémè has some links with the organization of science

#### Computational empiricism produces a state of theory disruption

>In a somewhat perverse way, it also promotes empirical results that destabilize former theoretical frameworks because they catch attention. However, it does not promote rethinking these frameworks, leading to what may be called a theory disruption that is more or less advanced depending on the fields —  (Montevil, 2021, p. 9)
