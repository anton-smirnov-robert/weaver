### On theoretical gaps and changes of perspectives

When we face a problem that we struggle to solve, it is common to say that we need to change perspective. 
Roughly, this means starting from a "kludged" new set of acceptable axioms from which we can solve our problem more easily.
When the problem is solved, you usually see the logical path that we could have taken from our first perspective. 
Our problem was that we did not find the pathwayin the first case, but it existed.
In fact, there is a lot of chance that your "kludged" new set of acceptable axioms and your initial ones are actually reducible to a common set of axioms. 

However, for more conceptually involved questions, such as scientific ones, you may not find such a pathway when you have solved you problem from a new perspective.
In fact, in mathematics, there are always undecidable statement for a given coherent set of axioms. This means that you need to posit new axioms to find new things. 
Therefore, mathematicians agree on accepting new axioms judging on what they are capable of producing.

This also same happens in physics. You cannot deduce quantum mechanics from the principles and laws of Galileo and Newton. 
It is only a posteriori that you can look at both framework and discuss the nature of their frontiere: are they reducible are not? 
In some cases, theories are not reducible to one another, they do not share the same principles.
Therefore, the frontier shows what I will call a *theoretical gap*.
There are some things that are in-between theoretical frameworks and that you cannot explain at all or solely in two incompatible ways. 
For instance, surfaces between materials are clear-cut in one framework and atomically rough in another. 

Now, this does not mean that we have an incoherent representation of reality, rather incomplete actually.
Reality exists without us, but it will always appear to us, and therefore to our understanding. 
If we agree on having some thin theoretical gaps between our theories, it means that we cannot always continuously advance by gathering data for instance. 
For science to progress, we need to have scientists ready to jump into the unknown to go on the over side and explore. 

Why am saying that ? Because I will now come close to the frontier of the physical continent to contemplate the gap.
This is for not putting axioms that are too far-reached to be conceivved at first. 
This is to avoid **incommensurability**.


### From purely physical perspectives



#### Old

For classical mechanics or thermodynamics, a generic organism and its environment constitute a large enough closed system. 
The phase space is the position and momenta of all atoms in the system. 
A equation governs the movement of atoms, starting from an living organism and an appropriate environnement state. 
The trajectory is deterministic but unpredictable for epistemic reasons—we are not Laplacian deamons— or practical reasons — if it is chaotic. 
Propagating the trajectory of the time scale of some minutes, hours, or even years would certainly not kill our generic organism. 
This is certainly the case for most organisms, as we can observe everyday.
However, the volume of microstate configurations in which the organism under scrutiny lives is extremly small with respect to the one where it is dead. 
According to the second law of thermodynamics and Boltzmann's reasoning, the organism should be dead quasi-instantaneously!
Of course, the entropy of the organism—with an appropriate definition— may not increase if the one of its environement does.
However, in the global phase space, the state of the system takes a *lifetime* to access for the first time the largest macrostate of the system that we can label "death" or "equilibrium".
In other words, if we wait long enough to be able to argue that our system *might* be ergodic on the basis that it has visited the two macrostates of our coarse-graining, our object would be qualified as dead by biologists. 
Therefore, everything that is of interest for biology in physics happens *out-of-equilibrium*.

Moreover, let's precise how non-ergodic is the system on the timescale of a lifetime. 
Let's zoom in on the trajectory of the organism in the "alive" macrostate[^1]. 
Let's make a coarse-graining of this macrostate by labelling regions corresponding *name-bearing types* of organisms.
Experimental observations tells us that an organism does not go through all living macrostates during its lifetime. 
For instance, an elephant does not become a rat during its life time. 
This means that an organism only explores an extremely small part of the living macrostate during its lifetime. 
Getting back to the global phase space, this means that the overall system is *highly non-ergodic, that is historical*.



How does all organisms span on this region?
Is the natural history of evolution on the unnivser also non-ergodic ?K

[^1]: Of course, we face major difficulties in practice to define such a macrostate because we do not *understand* the living attribute of an organism based on its atomic positons and velocities. However, it can define in principle, at least as the states in the phase space that points to (short sequences of) configurations of atoms that a human would acknowledge as alive. 



This 
However, in principle, we can do such a partition by defining an appropriate coarse-graining as usual.
We have seen that all living being will be dead at some point because of entropy. 


Of course, the entropy of the organism may not increase if the one of its environement does. However, in our global phase space that follows an unpredictable trajectory for epistemic reasons—we are not Laplacian deamons— 
Why are you still alive? Is the second law not valid for organisms? ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). Is this due to the special initial condition at the beginning of the universe that is unpacked by this chaotic dynamics? 
Is the futur worth living if it is already determined? Does consciouness, which must not relate to atoms, capable of agency to change this future? 

A lot of philosophical questions are actually linked to this apparent paradox. But the latter is not one to us because we are limited beings. We will let those questions to the Laplacian demiurge because we cannot measure all position and velocities. Trying is not an option because we would not be able to measure them precisely enough to make predictions for this chaotic system. Although there is a reality without us, it will always be the question of how we understand it. In science, we need a fallibilist rationale and experimental observations. It seems like we need to adopt a new perspective. 

However, before changing viewpoint, we need to know in which direction to go, at least on an informal basis. From this paradox, we understand that organims resist remarkably well to entropy. In other words, they manage to maintain themselves in a highly peculiar macrostate of the phase space. In turn, this means that from a mechanistic point of view atoms are positionned in singular positions, which means that we can observe some order or regularities. However, the central idea is not to be ordered but to remain so. Therefore, the current state of the particles of an organism makes them fulfill some goal, the one of self-maintaining the organism. In this sense, an organism is organized (it has an intrinsic telos). The first question we will be interested in is therefore: how to explain such an organization from a mechanistic point of view? We will soon answer this question in a lot of details. 

Intuitively, for the organism to remain in the viable macrostate despite the continuous variation of the state of its particles, there should some restoring force due to the initial variation, like a negative feedback loop in cybernetics. In fact, we will indeed see that there is a circularity at play. When structure are relatively stable, we can build physico-mathematical structures because we have drastically limited the area of the phase. In those space, once the phase space has been redesigned with pertinent observables, we can make model that can be controlled more easily, like in biophysics for parts of organisms.

However, organisms do evolve and develop such that they cannot be describe with the same circular organization in time. To be more precise, the viable macrostate can be divided in different parts, for all stage of development and ageing of a life time for instance. Indeed the size of your bones is not the same at 1 or  30 years so that you need to change the mechanistics models and therefore the organizational model when time flows. However, because the dimensionality of the underlying physico-mathematical phase space is tremedous, the dynamic is highly non-ergodic, and the system has no chance to go two times to the same microstate or to *go back to a macrostate it has left.* The dynamic is for us upnredictable so that each organism is a unique history of unpredictable variations. 



Now we can adopt of better view point. 
Out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics and look on the organism.
