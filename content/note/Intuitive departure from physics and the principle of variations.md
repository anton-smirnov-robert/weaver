For classical mechanics or thermodynamics, an organism and its environment constitute a large enough closed system. 
The phase space is the position and momenta of all atoms. We consider the deterministic equation that governs the movement of atoms starting from the reader's living state and it current environnement. Propagating the trajectory for a few minutes would most certainly not kill the reader â€” even though my writing is not so good. 

However, microstate configurations in which the organism lives are extremely rare in the phase, and the volume of the corresponding macrostate is therefore extremly negligeable with respect to the one where the reader does not live anymore. According to the second law of thermodynamics, death is certain. Yet, according to Boltzmann reasoning, the larger the volume of the macrostate, the faster we get to it. Therefore, you should be dead in a fraction of a second.  

Why are you still alive? Is the second law not valid for organisms? ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). Is this due to the special initial condition at the beginning of the universe that is unpacked by this chaotic dynamics? Is the futur worth living if it is already determined? Does consciouness, which must not relate to atoms, capable of agency to change this future? 

A lot of philosophical questions are actually linked to this apparent paradox. But the latter is not one to us because we are limited beings. We will let those questions to the Laplacian demiurge because we cannot measure all position and velocities. Trying is not an option because we would not be able to measure them precisely enough to make predictions for this chaotic system. Although there is a reality without us, it will always be the question of how we understand it. In science, we need a fallibilist rationale and experimental observations. It seems like we need to adopt a new perspective. 

However, before changing viewpoint, we need to know in which direction to go, at least on an informal basis. From this paradox, we understand that organims resist remarkably well to entropy. In other words, they manage to maintain themselves in a highly peculiar macrostate of the phase space. In turn, this means that from a mechanistic point of view atoms are positionned in singular positions, which means that we can observe some order or regularities. However, the central idea is not to be ordered but to remain so. Therefore, the current state of the particles of an organism makes them fulfill some goal, the one of self-maintaining the organism. In this sense, an organism is organized (it has an intrinsic telos). The first question we will be interested in is therefore: how to explain such an organization from a mechanistic point of view? We will soon answer this question in a lot of details. 

Intuitively, for the organism to remain in the viable macrostate despite the continuous variation of the state of its particles, there should some restoring force due to the initial variation, like a negative feedback loop in cybernetics. In fact, we will indeed see that there is a circularity at play. When structure are relatively stable, we can build physico-mathematical structures because we have drastically limited the area of the phase. In those space, once the phase space has been redesigned with pertinent observables, we can make model that can be controlled more easily, like in biophysics for parts of organisms.

However, organisms do evolve and develop such that they cannot be describe with the same circular organization in time. To be more precise, the viable macrostate can be divided in different parts, for all stage of development and ageing of a life time for instance. Indeed the size of your bones is not the same at 1 or  30 years so that you need to change the mechanistics models and therefore the organizational model when time flows. However, because the dimensionality of the underlying physico-mathematical phase space is tremedous, the dynamic is highly non-ergodic, and the system has no chance to go two times to the same microstate or to *go back to a macrostate it has left.* The dynamic is for us upnredictable so that each organism is a unique history of unpredictable variations. 



Now we can adopt of better view point. 
Out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics and look on the organism.
