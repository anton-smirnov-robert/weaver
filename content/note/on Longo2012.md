#### DNA was discovered in times that proned an informational metaphor to describe biological organization.

The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after an flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. The concepts of (hardware and software-independent) [computability](concept/computability.md), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developped in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (were cryptography played a major role), [Schrödinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrödinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. 

Programming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**,  **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). 

[Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) is an explanation for [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) using the four bases discovered in the DNA. It relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the "program" for producing proteins ([Danchin2002](reference/Danchin2002.md)). However, the DNA "software" taken from one cell (the "hardware") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very law succes and need to resort to "epigenetics reprogramming" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). Moreover, biological phenomena are not deterministic. For humans, the mortality of fertilized eggs (embryos) before giving birth is about 50% ([Jarvis2016](reference/Jarvis2016.md)). There is no Turing's architect and  robust, iterative steps. 

The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. Molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as "signals", "activator-receptor", or "docking".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md).
