According to Stiegler, the *différance* of Derrida is.

An organism *deffer* death ([principle of variation from physics](note/principle%20of%20variation%20from%20physics.md),[Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)), using the closure of constraints ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md)). 
In this highly non-ergodic domain, we can call it a process. 
In doing so, it *differentiates* itself from its environment, by drawing it own boundaries. 
To do so, it needs to ada

Those boundaries are physico-chemical *traces* ([Rovelli2022](reference/Rovelli2022.md)).
