According to Stiegler, the *différance* of Derrida is.

During the irreversible living *process*, an organism *deffer* death ([principle of variation from physics](note/principle%20of%20variation%20from%20physics.md),[Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)).
To do so, it *differentiates* itself from its environment, by drawing its own boundaries using the closure of constraints ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md)). 
To do so, it continuously *constrains* the thermodynamical flow to produces physico-chemical *traces* that *last* in time ([Rovelli2022](reference/Rovelli2022.md)).
To do so, it needs physico-chemical *constraints* that are invariant on the time scale of the process which produces *traces*.

>Le concept de « graphie » a besoin de la trace pour vivre et il implique « comme la possibilité commune à tous les systèmes de communication, l'instance de la _trace instituée_ » (1967 : 68). Lorsqu'on associe la _trace_ au _graphe_ (gestuel, visuel, pictural, musical, verbal), cette trace devient _gramme_ (lettre). À cet instant seulement apparaît le dehors (opposé du dedans), en tant qu' « extériorité spatiale et objective » ([Derrida2019](reference/Derrida2019.md) 1967 : 103).

There is a hierarchy between constraints and *traces* because one allows the second to be produced.
But a trace can also be established \[*instituée*\] in the organization, play a causal role, i.e. become a constraint.

Constraints are traces that are established as playing a causal role in the organization. 


When they play a role in the organization closure, those shapes are also shaping other constraints and therefore have a *function*. 
In different contexts, it differentiates differently to keep deffering death.
