According to Stiegler, the *différance* of Derrida is.

>the question of a *process* that, by *deffering* its own accomplishment, *differentiates* itself, this differentiation producing traces, which is also to say, *grammes*, forms of writing and of what Of Grammatology called ‘supplements’.

During the irreversible *process* of living, an organism *deffer* death ([principle of variation from physics](note/principle%20of%20variation%20from%20physics.md),[Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)).
To do so, it *differentiates* itself from its environment, by drawing its own boundaries ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md)). 
To do so, it *constrains* the thermodynamical flow to produces physico-chemical *traces*.


A ==trace== is a physico-chemical material entity made by an assemblage of smaller ones (usually atoms or small molecules). It obeys the second law of thermodynamic (in any large enough closed system) and is therefore doomed to disappear if not maintained on the timescale of its degradation. 

A ==graphe== is an abstract (or fictitiously immutable — i.e. that does not follow the second law) form which is required to build physico-mathematical structures (a square for a box, a point for an object, etc.). 

A ==*gramme*== — or a ==*constraint*== — is a graphe embodied in a trace. If the graphe is playing a role in a physico-mathematical structures. The materialization of the abstract object is a process of *deconstruction*.

>Le concept de « graphie » a besoin de la trace pour vivre et il implique « comme la possibilité commune à tous les systèmes de communication, l'instance de la _trace instituée_ » (1967 : 68). Lorsqu'on associe la _trace_ au _graphe_ (gestuel, visuel, pictural, musical, verbal), cette trace devient _gramme_ (lettre). À cet instant seulement apparaît le dehors (opposé du dedans), en tant qu' « extériorité spatiale et objective » ([Derrida2019](reference/Derrida2019.md) 1967 : 103).

A trace lasts in time if it is continuously maintained, which presuppose the maintenance of the constraint that allows it to be produced. 

A constraint is not a graph \[*graphie*\], an immutable form abstracted from its materiality.  It is itself based on an material entity, i.e. it is a *trace*. The deconstruction of physical models tells us that for the trace to last, the constraint needs also to be maintained. 





This hierarchy between traces and constraints is only relative because a trace can also be established \[*instituée*\] and play a causal role, i.e. becomes itself a constraint.

In different contexts, it differentiates differently to keep deffering death.

==Trace = Entitée physico-chimique qui subie la seconde loi. 
Graphe = Formes immuables, conditions aux bords ou paramètres souvant abstrait de leur matérialité. 
Gramme = Graphie matérialisée par une trace. Ici, c'est une **contrainte**.==



**Deconstruction** of physical models means challenging their physico-mathematical structure. It can take several forms: 
1) Giving a physico-chemical *trace* to the *geometrical*, *graphical*, *symbolic* abstract object. Challenging the existence of immutable objects (e.g. the box containing particles is made of atoms and will experience the second law). 
2) Don't take for granted the use of specific values of parameters that allow you to write down the physical system or boundary/initial conditions.
