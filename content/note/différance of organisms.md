According to Stiegler, the *différance* of Derrida is.

During the irreversible living *process*, an organism *deffer* death ([principle of variation from physics](note/principle%20of%20variation%20from%20physics.md),[Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)) using the closure of constraints ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md)). 
In doing so, it *differentiates* itself from its environment, by drawing it own boundaries. 
This *differentiation* is a necessary condition for it to defer death.  
In different contexts, it differentiates differently to keep deffering death.
In differentiating (to defer death), it produces physico-chemical *traces* ([Rovelli2022](reference/Rovelli2022.md)).
