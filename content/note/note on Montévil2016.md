#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**     
by Montévil M., Mossio M., Pocheville A., Longo G. (2016)         
*Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology* 122: 36-50

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. 
Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrasts to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### Symmetry in physics

The first part discuss the role of a [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md), and relates it to the idea of a generic, abstract object.

### Variation in biology as symmetry change

Organisms are not invariant under the flow of time, because they develop and evolve.

One way to accomodate those variations is to posit a mathematical structure that is used to single out the trajectory of generic objects (biological organisms) in a predefined space of pertinent possibilities that define observables (biological functions and their structure). This approach, that is at the core of physics, posit an invariant equation that governs the dynamics, and that is justified by an underlying [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md). 

Another way to accomodate functional variations in the biosphere is to understand the successive number of qualitative changes — in a way a function is performed by its structure, or the appearance or disappearance of new functions — as change of symmetries. Accordingly, this means that the mathematical apparatus to describe an organism is not constant throughout time. 

Note that the microscopic laws of physics

This leads to the principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

Organisms are not symmetric under permutation for a given theoretical analysis  Rather, an organism is an object defined by its history of unpredictable and context-dependent functional variations. It requires changing physico-mathematical structures (properties of objects, relevant observables, equations) to describe it throughtout time.

### Consequences of the principle of variation

On symmetrization (see note on [note on Montévil2019](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019.md)). 

Consequently, this means that novelties happen in an *unpredictable* ways, because there are no law underlying the dynamics (see [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md)).
