#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**     
by Montévil M., Mossio M., Pocheville A., Longo G. (2016)

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. 
Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrasts to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### Symmetry in physics

The first part discuss the role of a [symmetry in physics](concept/symmetry%20in%20physics.md), and relates it to the idea of a generic, abstract object.

### Variation in biology as symmetry breaking

Organisms are not invariant under the flow of time, because they develop and evolve.

One way to accomodate those variations is to posit a mathematical structure that is used to single out a trajectory for generic organisms, in an predefined space of pertinent observables (functions). Neo-preformationists, that posit complete genetic determination (via the non-metaphorical use of the "genetic program") uses such a view. The postulated one to one correspondance between a DNA sequence and phenotypes points to a predefined set of functional possibilities, the one that gathers all sequences one can make with nucleotides. Changes is this space are governed by mechanisms that describe interactions between organisms (more or less reduced to their DNA strands), and external forces (such as natural selection optimization principles). 

Another way to accomodate the functional variations throughout time is to understand the succesive number of qualitative changes — in a way a function is performed, or the appearance or disappearance of new functions — as change of symmetries. Accordingly, this means that the mathematical apparatus to describe organisms is not constant throughout time. Consequently, this means that novelties happen in an unpredictable ways. 


We argue that the first approach, which is enshrined in the [Modern Synthesis](concept/Modern%20Synthesis.md), is limited because:
1) the one to one correspondance between a phenotype and a proteome was never explicited, and the expression of the genetic code is complex and has contextual influences ([Stadler2001](reference/Stadler2001.md), [Huang2009](reference/Huang2009.md), [David2013](reference/David2013.md)).
2) the phase space is not relevant, because we cannot assess even the viability of an organism based on a DNA sequence. 
3) genes cannot solely explain changes of organisms on ontogenetic and phylogenetic times scales ([Laland2015](reference/Laland2015.md)).
