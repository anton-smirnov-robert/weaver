#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrast to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### How does physics work? 

Physics centrally relies on the concept of [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md) to understand change, trajectories.

### Could physics provide a rigourous framework for biology? 

The objects of biology are organisms, but organisms are not invariant under the flow of time, because they develop and evolve. Therefore, physics cannot use organisms as an object *per se*. In physics, an organisms can only be encountered as result of the interactions between a multitude of invariant objects. However, even cells change, appear, and die. Physics must then use sub-cellular elements to describe organisms. It appears that physics is still far from being able to understand or model one cell. Therefore, while being different from physics, an rigorous theoretical frame that uses organisms as objects, could increase objectivity in biology. 

### How to depart from physics?

In physics, objects are abstract mathematical objects, which are extracted from the flow of time. They are defined by some properties that can be shared: they are generic. This is not the case of organisms and we depart from physics by stating *the principle of variation*: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

Specific is the contrary of generic. Two organisms always have a qualitative difference for a given theoretical frame. 

### Where does this specificty come from?

Positing this principle is equivalent to escaping the complete deterministic view of biological phenomena. 
In biology, the latter is enshrined in the (neo)preformationist view of development or fixist view of evolution. 
In physics, the latter from a reductionnist view of biological phenomena, which claims that biology can be understood in terms of deterministic trajectories of atoms. 

Letting aside, simplistic resolution of paradoxes by calling the indetermiancy of quantum effects or a chaotic systems. 

But, this can also be state in physics. If one uses the position and velocity of all particles that constitutes a organism, it entails complete determinism. If one uses all combination of DNA, it is the same. We argue that this is not a pertinent phase space, because it has no biological meaning: for example to express their viability.

This relies on the highly non-ergodicty of those phase spaces in life time. Departing from those spaces means [Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md) [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md) aassuming 




The cost of conserving meaning and scientific rigor, that is objectivity, comes at the cost of being able to deal with: 
- unpredictable novelties (unpredictable novelties can emerge)
- history (the current space of possibilities can only be understand with the help of the past)


In contrast to physical objects, organisms vary in a strong sense: the mathematical structure to describe them is not stable with the respect to the flow of time. Underlying symmetries change in time. 


Another way to accomodate functional variations in the biosphere is to understand the successive number of qualitative changes — in a way a function is performed by its structure, or the appearance or disappearance of new functions — as change of symmetries. Accordingly, this means that the mathematical apparatus to describe an organism is not constant throughout time. 


 Rather, an organism is an object defined by its history of unpredictable and context-dependent functional variations. It requires changing physico-mathematical structures (properties of objects, relevant observables, equations) to describe it throughtout time.

### Consequences of the principle of variation

On symmetrization (see note on [note on Montévil2019](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019.md)). 

Consequently, this means that novelties happen in an *unpredictable* ways, because there are no law underlying the dynamics (see [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md)).
