#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**     
by Montévil M., Mossio M., Pocheville A., Longo G. (2016)         
*Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology* 122: 36-50    

Reference : [Montevil2016](reference/Montevil2016.md)

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. 
Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrasts to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### Symmetry in physics

An initial part discuss the role of a [symmetry in physics](concept/symmetry%20in%20physics.md), and relates it to the idea of  a generic, abstract object.
