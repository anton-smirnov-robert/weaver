#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**     
by Montévil M., Mossio M., Pocheville A., Longo G. (2016)         
*Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology* 122: 36-50

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. 
Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrasts to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### Symmetry in physics

The first part discuss the role of a [symmetry in physics](concept/symmetry%20in%20physics.md), and relates it to the idea of a generic, abstract object.

### Variation in biology as symmetry breaking

Organisms are not invariant under the flow of time, because they develop and evolve.

One way to accomodate those variations with a unique mathematical structure is to refer to a trajectory in an predefined space of pertinent observables, having singled out a shared property of generic organisms. A neo-preformationist view, that posit complete genetic determination (via the non-metaphorical use of the word "genetic program") uses such a view. The postulated one to one correspondance between a DNA sequence and phenotypes points to a predefined set of possibilities, the one that gathers all sequences one can make with nucleotides. The equation is given by *interactions* between *generic* DNA strands (mutations, drift, etc.) and an external force (natural selection). This approach is limited because: 
1) the one to one correspondance between biological functions and DNA was never explicited.   (see also [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md)) [Huang2009](reference/Huang2009.md) [David2013](reference/David2013.md)
2) most DNA strands are not viable, which makes the corresponding phase space irrelevant ([Stadler2001](reference/Stadler2001.md)).
3) genes cannot solely explain changes of organisms on ontogenetic and phylogenetic times scales ([Laland2015](reference/Laland2015.md)). 
Again, at the core of this reasonning lies the identification of symmetries that imply invariant transformations, such as permutation of genomes (software) in cells of different species (hardware).



Another way to accomodate the variation of organisms in time is to 

— yet they have been shown to be insufficient to understand living (epigenetics, niche construction, plasticity, etc.).

 — yet, no equations or 1 to 1 correspondance have been given

An underlying symmetry that justifies the existence of an equation for organisms, conceived as generic objects.

This means adopting a neo-preformationist view of complete genetic determination for ontogenesis and a fixist view for evolution. 


The first,uch that symmetry changes happen on various space and time scales. 

Because of the successive symmetry changes, the physico-mathematical apparatus (properties of the object, pertinent observables, equation) needed to describe an organism change in time. 

If the same mathematical structure could be used, one should prestate pertinent find an invariant symmetry, which would ultimately end up with the neo-preformationist view of complete genetic determination, or fixist-like theories negating Darwin's contribution.  

Not acknowledging this means that preformationists
Such that the organism 
Accordingly, organisms are no longer generic objects.

In contrast to physics, symmetry breaking is tantamount in biology such that mathematical structures to describe it are changing over time. 

Because symmetry is changing, the
