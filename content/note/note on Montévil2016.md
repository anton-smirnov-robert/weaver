#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. 
Other roots of the idea come from  [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrasts to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### About physics theories

- Physics uses **generic** objects : objects sharing some common properties (mass, charge, legnth, etc. ) that can be permutated while leaving the theoretical analysis invariant.
This is because physics co-evolved with mathematics, that use abstract objects. Any abstract object of mass $m$ is generic, because it can be a shoe or an apple for classical mechanics. 

- The underlying mathematical equation do not change during the dynamics of the object, because change is to be understand in a restricted sense, as a change of **the state** of the object (or the system). 

- The state of the object is therefore to be **predefined** in a phase space which states all the possibilities in advance. 

- Equations governing the change of state of generic objects are valid in the entire predefined phase space. Therefore, they 

There is always an underlying **invariant** that comes from a symmetry. 


- , because there is an invariant. 


A shoe or an apple with the same mass can be permutated from the point of view of classical mechanics.

, defined by shared properties (such as mass, charge, etc.) and that follow specific trajectories. A theoretical symmetry underlies this description in a phase space.
