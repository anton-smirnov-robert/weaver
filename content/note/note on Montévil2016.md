The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrast to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### How does physics work? 

Physics centrally relies on the concept of [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md) to understand change, trajectories.

### Could physics provide a rigourous framework for biology? 

The objects of biology are organisms, but organisms are not invariant under the flow of time, because they develop and evolve. Therefore, physics cannot use organisms as an object *per se*. In physics, an organisms can only be encountered as result of the interactions between a multitude of invariant objects. However, even cells are created, change, and disappear. Physics must then use sub-cellular elements to describe organisms. We will go back later to this option. Yet, pragmatically, physics is still far from being able to understand or model a single cell. Therefore, while being different from physics, an rigorous theoretical frame that uses organisms as objects, could increase objectivity in biology. 

### Which theoretical frame?

In physics, objects are abstract mathematical objects, which are extracted from the flow of time. They are defined by some properties that can be shared: they are generic. This is not the case of organisms such that a first principle can be stated. 

*The principle of variation*: ==organisms are **specific** objects==.

Specific can be understood as the contrary of generic. Specific objects are material objects, and two of them always have a qualitative difference with respect to a given theoretical frame. 

### Where does this specificty come from?

Positing this principle is equivalent to escaping a deterministic view of biological phenomena. The latter is enshrined in physicalist reductionnism (theories of natural sciences are reducible to those of physics), that usually take two aspects. For neopreformationist, it is complete genetic determinism. Life can be written by combinations of four letters, materialized by nucleotides. Therefore, organisms can be enumerated, and they all preexist. For others, living beings can be understood with the deterministic trajectories of atoms because they are made of such paticles. Of course, those two claims are seldom endorsed as such by scientists. Rather, they are moderated by mentioning epigenetics in the first case, the impredictibility of quantum mechanics or chaos theory in the second. 

However, in both cases, problems do *not* emerge from the fact that additional effects are ignored (which would make complete determinism a bad approximation). Rather, — and this is essential — it lies in the fact that the chosen observables are not pertinent for the understanding of organisms, starting with their viability. A extraordinary small part of those phase spaces are relevant for biology, *as far as we know*. Even if we endorse complete genetic determinism, DNA sequences that program for living beings represent an extremely small part. Atomic positions and velocities that can be attribuated to organisms are nearly singularities in the corresponding phase space.

In both case, the problem of the purely physicalist approach lies within the definition of the pertinent observables for biology. Sequences of nucleotides or atomic positions are bad observables to generically define organisms, starting by their viability. As a result

The modern . 

Letting aside, simplistic resolution of paradoxes by calling the indetermiancy of quantum effects or a chaotic systems. 

But, this can also be state in physics. If one uses the position and velocity of all particles that constitutes a organism, it entails complete determinism. If one uses all combination of DNA, it is the same. We argue that this is not a pertinent phase space, because it has no biological meaning: for example to express their viability.

This relies on the highly non-ergodicty of those phase spaces in life time. Departing from those spaces means [Kauffman2019](reference/Kauffman2019.md) [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md) assuming 




The cost of conserving meaning and scientific rigor, that is objectivity, comes at the cost of being able to deal with: 
- unpredictable novelties (unpredictable novelties can emerge)
- history (the current space of possibilities can only be understand with the help of the past)


In contrast to physical objects, organisms vary in a strong sense: the mathematical structure to describe them is not stable with the respect to the flow of time. Underlying symmetries change in time. 


Another way to accomodate functional variations in the biosphere is to understand the successive number of qualitative changes — in a way a function is performed by its structure, or the appearance or disappearance of new functions — as change of symmetries. Accordingly, this means that the mathematical apparatus to describe an organism is not constant throughout time. 


 Rather, an organism is an object defined by its history of unpredictable and context-dependent functional variations. It requires changing physico-mathematical structures (properties of objects, relevant observables, equations) to describe it throughtout time.

### Consequences of the principle of variation

On symmetrization (see note on [note on Montévil2019](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019.md)). 

Consequently, this means that novelties happen in an *unpredictable* ways, because there are no law underlying the dynamics (see [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md)).
