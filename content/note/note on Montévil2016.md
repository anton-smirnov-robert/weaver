The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. Other roots of the idea come from [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrast to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### How does physics work? 

Physics centrally relies on the concept of [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md) to understand change, trajectories.

### Could physics provide a rigourous framework for biology? 

The objects of biology are organisms, but organisms are not invariant under the flow of time, because they develop and evolve. Therefore, physics cannot use organisms as an object *per se*. In physics, an organisms can only be encountered as result of the interactions between a multitude of invariant objects. However, even cells are created, change, and disappear. Physics must then use sub-cellular elements to describe organisms. We will go back later to this option. Yet, pragmatically, physics is still far from being able to understand or model a single cell. Therefore, while being different from physics, an rigorous theoretical frame that uses organisms as objects, could increase objectivity in biology. 

### Which theoretical frame?

In physics, objects are abstract mathematical objects, which are extracted from the flow of time. They are defined by some properties that can be shared: they are generic. This is not the case of organisms such that a first principle can be stated. 

*The principle of variation*: ==organisms are **specific** objects==.

Specific can be understood as the contrary of generic. Specific objects are material objects, and two of them always have a qualitative difference with respect to a given theoretical frame. 

### Where does this specificty come from?

Positing this principle is equivalent to moving fom a deterministic view of biological phenomena. The latter is enshrined in physicalist reductionnism (theories of natural sciences are reducible to those of physics), that usually take two aspects. For neopreformationist, it is complete genetic determinism. Life can be written by combinations of four letters, materialized by nucleotides. Therefore, organisms can be enumerated, and they all preexist. For others, living beings can be understood with the deterministic trajectories of atoms because they are made of such particles. Of course, those two claims are seldom endorsed as such by scientists. Rather, they are moderated by mentioning epigenetics in the first case, the impredictibility of quantum mechanics or chaos theory in the second. 

However, in both cases, problems do not emerge from the fact that additional effects are ignored (which would make complete determinism a bad approximation). Rather, — and this is essential — it lies in the fact that the chosen observables are not pertinent for the *understanding* of organisms, starting with their viability. A extraordinary small part of those phase spaces are relevant for biology, *as far as we know*. Even if we endorse complete genetic determinism, DNA sequences that program living beings represent an extremely small number of all the ones that can be enumerated. Atomic positions and velocities that can be attribuated to organisms are nearly singularities in the corresponding phase space. There is no such things such as a typical DNA sequence or a typical position of atoms that could generically define an organism. Almost all elements of those space do not represent an organism. 

Giving up on these kind of descriptions because of their lack of biological meaning, does not imply ignoring their importance in other theoretical frames (e.g., for DNA sequencing, for physics). However, for biology, they only constitute pre-possibilities ([note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md)). We need to gather some of the biological meaningful pre-possibilities to constitute a subset a pertinent set of possibilities, *as far as we can tell*. This requires finding those singularities in the original phase space, redefining the observables[^1] to gather those possibilities in an extremely small set, and zooming in. We argue that only after this transformation one can talk objectively about organisms (bio-*logos*). 

The cost of conserving objectivity comes at the cost of being able to deal with two crucial aspects of the objects described in this new subset of biological meaningful possibilities. First, the only way to add a possibility is by having seen it being realized. In other words, the pertinent space of description of organisms is *historical*. Second, adding a new possibility means that the organism has realized this possibility, and that it was not one before that. Therefore, organisms can vary in a fundamentally *unpredictable* way for the theoretical framework. This defines randomness in biology, which is not endowed with a probability measure. Third, because the pertinent observables are established according to the current possibilities, the phase space of biological possibilities also change in time, because the pertinent observables also change. 

We can now understand the specific objects: they are historical objects that undergo unpredictable variations. This forces the mathematical structure to describe them to change in time.

### Consequences of the principle of variation

On symmetrization (see note on [note on Montévil2019](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019.md)). 

Consequently, this means that novelties happen in an *unpredictable* ways, because there are no law underlying the dynamics (see [note on Montévil2019a](note/note%20on%20Montévil2019a.md)).

[^1]: It will be argued elsewhere that the pertinent observables for biology are material entities that have a [biological function](concept/biological%20function.md) or that are constrained by them — those term will be defined.
