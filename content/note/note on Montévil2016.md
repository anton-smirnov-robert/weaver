### Introduction



### How does physics work? 

Physics centrally relies on the concept of [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md) to understand change, trajectories.

[^1]: It will be argued elsewhere that the pertinent observables for biology are material entities that have a [biological function](concept/biological%20function.md) or that are constrained by them — those term will be defined. In the folllowing, pertinent observables and functional part are synonymous.
