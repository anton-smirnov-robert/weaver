#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. Other roots of the idea come from ([Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md)) and ([Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md)).
Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...
In contrast to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### How does physics work? 

Physics centrally relies on the concept of [symmetry](concept/symmetry.md) to understand change, trajectories.

### Consequences of the principle of variation

[^1]: It will be argued elsewhere that the pertinent observables for biology are material entities that have a [biological function](concept/biological%20function.md) or that are constrained by them — those term will be defined. In the folllowing, pertinent observables and functional part are synonymous.
