#### **Theoretical principles for biology: Variation**     
by Montévil M., Mossio M., Pocheville A., Longo G. (2016)         
*Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology* 122: 36-50

The principle of variation: ==organisms are **specific** objects==. 

### Introduction

This comes from the notion of “descent with modification” of Darwin ([Darwin1859](reference/Darwin1859.md)). Compared to Lamarck, Darwin states that variations come from "chance", they are not directed. The latter would imply a deterministic framework and therefore anhistoricity. 
Other roots of the idea come from  [Beatty1995](reference/Beatty1995.md) and [Gould2002](reference/Gould2002.md).

Variation, as a principle, does not need a justification. However, one can find it in chaotic processes, random gene expression, cellular proliferation with two non-identical cells, etc...

In contrasts to Darwin's idea, variation also occur during ontogenesis (not only for phylogenesis). 

### Symmetries in physical theories

See also [Longo2014](reference/Longo2014.md) and [VanFraassen1989](reference/VanFraassen1989.md) for this part. 
- Physics uses **generic** objects: objects sharing some common properties (mass, charge, length, etc. ) that can be permutated while leaving the theoretical analysis invariant. This is because physics co-evolved with mathematics, that uses abstract objects. Any abstract object of mass $m$ is generic, because it can be a shoe or an apple for classical mechanics. They are *identical* for a given theory.

- The underlying mathematical equation do not change during the dynamics of the object, because change is to be understand in a somewhat restricted sense, as a change of **the state** of the object (or the system) in a **predefined** space (called "phase space" in physics). The latter fixes the pertinent observables (position, momenta, angle, energy, etc.) and gives all the possibilities in advance. 

- Equations governing the change of state of generic objects are valid in the entire phase space. They are not concerned by the specific values of the object's propreties, but they are rather concerned about the *relations* between the properties of objects. Most physical properties are actually defined in a relational way (charge, mass, friction coefficients, solubility elasticity, etc.). 

- At the core of physical description of matter — objects, phase space, and equations — lies the crucial notion of **symmetry**, which is invariance under transformation. We have seen that generic objects are symmetric for the intended theory. Equations in physics or chemistry are obtained using symmetry arguments, such as conservation laws (see Noether's theorem for instance). Relevant physical quantities that define phase spaces (energy, momentum, position, concentrations, etc.) are defined in terms of symmetries in time or space, or quantity, etc..
