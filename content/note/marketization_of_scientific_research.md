Research activities carried out before the 60's were convincingly described by Polanyi using market-inspired models. The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism, but still resort to the invisible hand metaphor, for instance. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a "commited" and "flexible" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions "stakeholders" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research. 

We gives five caracteristics of the marketization and industrialisation of research. 

#### Research needing an exogeous cause
When Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)) emphasizes that the "continued existence" of Science depends on its "self-renewal", he points to the teleological nature of the research entreprise for societies. In contrast, market needs an exogeous cause to evolve, change its prices ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)). Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. Making research activities offer response to external demand is a first characteristic of marketisation. 

#### Division of labour prevail upon overlapping neigbourhood
Overlapping neighborhood ensure shared expertise on specific subject. It is the place where the authority of scientific standards is ensured and where critical thinking takes place. In fact, we can understand the peer review process described with Polanyi's scientific standards, with Morin's dialogical principle, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity that cannot be reduced to mere juxtaposition of the two. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. When modifying the dialogical nature of the scientific standards by defining a third criteria such "relevance with respect to societal needs", it occurs what has be qualified as an "epistemic drift" ([Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md)). I understand this "drift" as the transformation from an antagonism (*anta* which is face-to-face and *agônisma*, struggle) into a competition (*concurrence*, *concourir* in french), a race toward the same objective. This semantic turn allows us to articulate a regime of theoretical disputes for the best arguments on common subjects to a regime where free competition gives you the liberty to isolate yourself from existing competition. This allows you to create a new specific field, far from competition to optimize your chance of having the priority over a discovery ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). According to Morin, the most fundamental condition for science to exists lies: "what must be absolutly safeguarded is the conflictual plurality in a game that obeys empirico-logical rules" ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md), p. 24). We should understand Morin's idea not only as a sufficient but also necessary. When this "epistemic drift" becomes important, the overlapping neighborhood area decreases and we enter a regime of division of labour, that is "scientific" organization of reasearch. The allocation of grants will be "optimize" in order to avoid "risk of duplication" and 'limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). *Everything happens like if, under the requirement of participating to at least one match of a infinite box competition, you allowed the possibility of chosing the referee position. You are no longer guaranteed that matches still take place. 

#### Smith's inert employee principle prevail upon Merton's curiosity momentum
Principles frame how we understand phenomena. In *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith posits the equivalent of Gallileo's inertial principle: "It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can, (...)" ([Smith1887](reference/Smith1887.md)). This principle is framing capitalism, because it implies that people are lazy and that they work if and only if they are paid ([Schwartz2015](reference/Schwartz2015.md)). In contrast, Merton posited another principle for research: "the pursuit of science is culturally defined as being primarily a disinterested search for truth and only secondarily, a means of earning a livelihood." ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). Merton therefore acknowledge a principled momentum due to curiosity. Depending which principle about human nature is adopted, science policies change and the vocabulary with it.  In one case, the "scientific workforce" is given "incentives" to which it "responds". Researchers do not ask interesting enough questions and one must prompt them to take more risks ([OECD2021a](reference/OECD2021a.md)). Management practices come into play to maximize productivity such that the "awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause" make them "proud of being European" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/)), "an incentive for surpassing oneself" ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). In fact, instauring a climate of "Darwinian selection" bewteen scientists ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)) foster rushing that, in turn, deteriorate the quality of science ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Yong2018](reference/Yong2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)). On the other hand, by using the second principle, it is acknowledged that research is grounded in human's curiosity. Therefore, science policies would reflect on how to maintain this curiosity productive, be it by encouraging specific lifestyles and advise against other (such as too much work), reflect on how researchers collaborate, etc. 

#### Proletarization of researchers
The loss of the capacity to design original research projects, because this role has been conferred to the market mecanisms. In this process, the art of identifying and expliciting relevant scientific directions is externalized and assured automatically to make the scientific offer meet "stakeholders" demand ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). The latter stem from an average of concerns[^1] at a given time, which is constituated by a protocole and takes the form of a "mission-oriented" project. This transfer of know-how to a mechanized machinary corresponds Marx's idea of proletarization ([Marx2005](reference/Marx2005.md)), extended to the capacity to design following Stielger ([Stiegler2012](reference/Stiegler2012.md), [Alombert2021](reference/Alombert2021.md)). From a larger perspective, this is loss begins with the introduction of competitive project-based fundings that indirectly drive the elaboration of projects towards predefined directions. 

#### Researchers individuality fade away
This builds on the dominant positivist philosophy in Science that consider their subjectivity as a noise when probing the natural world. In this view, the scientific "workforce" is commutable, discoveries do not depend on specific researchers. This focus the attention on the quantitative aspect of research such as the concentration of elementary and identical — or unidimensionallized (good or bad) depending on the output rate — scientists in specific domains. This loss of individuality is translated in impersonal format of scientific articles, in the name of objectivity. The structure of scientific articles (IMRaD) contextualize a single unbiased observation to transform it into knowledge. They gather easy-to-find informations to communicate more efficiently ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). This reveals a cumulative view of knowledge — already present in Polanyi's puzzle metaphor ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)) —  and points to a market-like communication of information. In contrast, experimenting is a project that stage a highly specific situation of the world. It is motivated by a scientific goal and derives from an interpretation of the theoretical framework it relies upon ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). Using the informational language implies that the receiver and the emeter are left unchanged during the process. This is absolutely not the goal in research, where one should be partly surprised in reading articles. Note that this process can be considered as an aspect of proletarization, following ([Simondon1958](reference/Simondon1958.md)). Indeed, for Simondon, the proletarian is dissociated from his workplace. She transform herself and its environment by imprinting its subjectivity. 

#### Neglecting reflexivity increase productivity
The separation between philosophy and science swepping out reflexivity from the scientific activity. Scientific disciplines have a long history, they use specific methods and rely on metaphysical assumptions. Elementary history and philosophy of science helps in replacing the scientific activity for the cultural "tradition" it is, gaining intellectual hygiene against the believe of creating the sacred and universal Truth. Moreover, theoretical thinking is a crucial activity that play a central role in science, specifically when renewing fields of research. Theories defines observables how phenomena that require explanation. The "self-renewal" of disciplines depends on this reflexive and critical activity, whose down side is to have a low productivity compared to empirical approaches. Biology ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), [Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)) and  psychological sciences ([Muthukrishna2019](reference/Muthukrishna2019.md)) are both experiencing important problems at this level. An industrialized research jeopardize its existence by focysing on productivity, neglecting theoretical thinking. 

#### Use of "commercial morals"
Research make sense only as a collective work because the "mutual adjustement of independent initiatives" make sense only if a given article permit an adjustement. 

requires researchers to be "self-interested", only to a given extent. It should be implicitely assume that articles researchers write should sincerely help others in their own initiatives.  
Given that the production of research articles The production of scientifc articles
Use of "commercial morals". Loose the fact the you belong to a community and you work for yourself. It is permitted by the "epistemic drift" Fold back on yourself working for you and not for others. ([Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)). uses "commerical morals" (reproductability, Goodhart's law) and false promises (Audétat), "sell your research" and avoid complexity. working for you and not others

##### Automaticity is automatically the mean and the goal of research  
6) automaticity of design (taking the mean, no commitment, synthetical work only statistical,  (Anderson), entropy, [Longo2013](reference/Longo2013.md) "common sense", (Stielger,montévil,Bifurquer) )
7) automaticity by protocolization (only what is operational is kept in theories, Morin1982). Synthetic let to ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)) 
8) technique and automaticity is how problems are solved (naive view of robots,  embarrassingly assumed to be technological innovations and/or economic growth, citizens)

#### Dangers
1) Les scientifiques sont leurs propre autorité. La prolètarization des scientifiques est la fin de la science.
2) It entails a partition of science, without theoretical controversies, that can leave fields in state of *theory disruption* ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)).
3) Disruption du second order, entropy, common sense, this aspect is dangerous because may lead to 
4) Real role of citizens. Credit impot research, end of research for mutinational, pillage des fonds publics. 
5) Naive ideology about technology seem natural to scietists. 


#### Principles

The "ivory tower" is not considered scientists as citizen. 
Science has no goal and requires no ideological commitment.
Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. There is no signal for true novelties that cannot be predicted (no linear model).Science is a bet with no insurance. 
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.
Scientists are crucials should be involved. (rethink this position). 


The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.
The lost role of affects. Value is affect.


[^1]: Another possibility that is not considered by policy makers and that would be different from this averaging is to take random directions from citizens or industrials. However, the pertinence of such directions is doubtious.
