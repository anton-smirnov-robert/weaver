Research activities carried out before the 60's were convincingly described by Polanyi using market-inspired models. The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism, but still resort to the invisible hand metaphor, for instance. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a "commited" and "flexible" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions "stakeholders" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research. 

We gives five caracteristics of the marketization and industrialisation of research. 

#### Research needing an exogeous cause
When Polanyi emphasizes that the "continued existence" of Science depends on its "self-renewal", he points to the teleological nature of the research entreprise for societies. In contrast, the market needs an exogeous cause to evolve, change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. Making research activities offer response to external demand is a first characteristic of marketisation. Answered questions raise many more, which will be absurd not to tackle for the sole reason that it has not been demanded. 

#### Division of labour prevail upon overlapping neigbourhood

#### Caracterizing marketization 
- partition and division of labor (no overlap, no conflict -Morin-, no synthesis).  No dialogical nature of scientific merit. 
- scientists are seen as Smith's inert human (not enough motivated, they are lazy, workforce, not enough risks and vocabulary). We need artificial competition between them (Darwin), perte de performance, management (give them a goal) etc... In contrast to Merton. 
- proletarization of scientists who are 
1) desubjectivized, considered as noise for a purely empirical work (new positivism). An empty virgin receptacle for communication via standardized information channels.
3) they lose their capacity to design the projects they want to work upon: it is given the mechanism of the market (the demand of citizen, public what they should look for). 
4) no reflexivity on its work (history, philosophy, epistemology, theory of discipline and science). Inventiton is contextual (Stielger,montévil,Bifurquer) et 
5) uses "commerical morals" (reproductability, Goodhart's law) and false promises (Audétat), "sell your research" and avoid complexity
- confusion between objectity and automaticity 
6) automaticity of design (taking the mean, no commitment, entropy, (Stielger,montévil,Bifurquer) )
7) automaticity by protocolization (only what is operational is kept in theories, Morin1982)
8) technique and automaticity is how problems are solved (naive view of robots,embarrassingly assumed to be technological innovations and/or economic growth, citizens)

#### Dangers
Un mot sur les dangers : les scientifiques sont leurs propre autorité. La prolètarization des scientifiques est la fin de la science.
Numerous questions arise regarding the real benefits of citizens in this process that takes place in a very specific and naive frame regarding technology.

#### Principles
Science has no goal and requires no ideological commitment.
Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. There is no signal for true novelties that cannot be predicted (no linear model).
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.
Science is a bet with no insurance. 


The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.
The lost role of affects. Value is affect.
