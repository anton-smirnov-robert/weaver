Research activities carried out before the 60's were convincingly described by Polanyi using market-inspired models. The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism, but still resort to the invisible hand metaphor, for instance. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a "commited" and "flexible" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions "stakeholders" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research. 

We gives five caracteristics of the marketization and industrialisation of research. 

#### Research needing an exogeous cause
When Polanyi ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md)) emphasizes that the "continued existence" of Science depends on its "self-renewal", he points to the teleological nature of the research entreprise for societies. In contrast, market needs an exogeous cause to evolve, change its prices ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)). Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. Making research activities offer response to external demand is a first characteristic of marketisation. 

#### Division of labour prevail upon overlapping neigbourhood
Overlapping neighborhood ensure shared expertise on specific subject. It is the place where the authority of scientific standards is ensured and where critical thinking takes place. In fact, we can understand the peer review process described with Polanyi's scientific standards, with Morin's dialogical principle, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity that cannot be reduced to mere juxtaposition of the two. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. When modifying the dialogical nature of the scientific standards by defining a third criteria such "relevance with respect to societal needs", it occurs what has be qualified as an "epistemic drift" ([Elzinga1997](reference/Elzinga1997.md)). I understand this "drift" as the transformation from an antagonism (*anta* which is face-to-face and *agônisma*, struggle) into a competition (*concurrence*, *concourir* in french), a race toward the same objective. This semantic turn allows us to articulate a regime of theoretical disputes for the best arguments on common subjects to a regime where free competition gives you the liberty to isolate yourself from existing competition. This allows you to create a new specific field, far from competition to optimize your chance of having the priority over a discovery ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). According to Morin, the most fundamental condition for science to exists lies: "what must be absolutly safeguarded is the conflictual plurality in a game that obeys empirico-logical rules" ([Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md), p. 24). We should understand Morin's idea not only as a sufficient but also necessary. When this "epistemic drift" becomes important, the overlapping neighborhood area decreases and we enter a regime of division of labour, that is "scientific" organization of reasearch. The allocation of grants will be "optimize" in order to avoid "risk of duplication" and 'limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). *Everything happens like if, under the requirement of participating to at least one match of a infinite box competition, you allowed the possibility of chosing the referee position. You are no longer guaranteed that matches still take place. 

#### Smith's inert employee principle prevail upon Merton's curiosity momentum
Principles frame how we understand phenomena. In *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith posits the equivalent of Gallileo's inertial principle: "It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can, (...)" ([Smith1887](reference/Smith1887.md)). This principle is framing capitalism, because it implies that people are lazy and that they work if and only if they are paid ([Schwartz2015](reference/Schwartz2015.md)). In contrast, Merton posited another principle for research: "the pursuit of science is culturally defined as being primarily a disinterested search for truth and only secondarily, a means of earning a livelihood." ([Merton1957](reference/Merton1957.md)). Merton therefore acknowledge a principled momentum due to curiosity. Depending which principle about human nature is adopted, science policies change and the vocabulary with it.  In one case, the "scientific workforce" is given "incentives" to which it "responds". Researchers do not ask interesting enough questions and one must prompt them to take more risks ([OECD2021a](reference/OECD2021a.md)). Management practices come into play to maximize productivity such that the "awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause" make them "proud of being European" ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/)), "an incentive for surpassing oneself" ([Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)). In fact, instauring a climate of "Darwinian selection" bewteen scientists ([Petit2019a](reference/Petit2019a.md)) foster rushing that, in turn, deteriorate the quality of science ([Anderson2007](reference/Anderson2007.md), [Chavalarias2016](reference/Chavalarias2016.md), [Yong2018](reference/Yong2018.md), [Hill2020](reference/Hill2020.md)). On the other hand, by using the second principle, it is acknowledged that research is grounded in human's curiosity. Therefore, science policies would reflect on how to maintain this curiosity productive, be it by encouraging specific lifestyles and advise against other (such as too much work), reflect on how researchers collaborate, etc. 

#### Proletarization of researchers

1) "Loss of knowledge" and transfer to technology (MARX). Synthetic let to ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)) and design (STIEGLER) know-how (let to the market). (+Anderson)
2) "Désindividuation" de SIMONDON (virgin receptacle, scientist is a noise for positivist science). You send signals with IMRaD ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)). Objectivity of science (Canghuilhem)
3) "Fatalist" aspect of loosing the capacity of its own diagnosis of your situation (history, philosophy, epistemology, theory of discipline and science, épistémè). ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md))

#### Use of "commercial morals"

Use of "commercial morals". Loose the fact the you belong to a community and you work for yourself. It is permitted by the "epistemic drift" Fold back on yourself working for you and not for others. ([Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)). uses "commerical morals" (reproductability, Goodhart's law) and false promises (Audétat), "sell your research" and avoid complexity. working for you and not others

##### Automaticity is automatically the mean and the goal of research  
6) automaticity of design (taking the mean, no commitment, synthetical work only statistical,  (Anderson), entropy, [Longo2013](reference/Longo2013.md) "common sense", (Stielger,montévil,Bifurquer) )
7) automaticity by protocolization (only what is operational is kept in theories, Morin1982)
8) technique and automaticity is how problems are solved (naive view of robots,  embarrassingly assumed to be technological innovations and/or economic growth, citizens)

#### Dangers
Un mot sur les dangers : les scientifiques sont leurs propre autorité. La prolètarization des scientifiques est la fin de la science.
Numerous questions arise regarding the real benefits of citizens in this process that takes place in a very specific and naive frame regarding technology.
It entails a partition of science, without theoretical controversies, that can leave fields in state of *theory disruption* ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)).

#### Principles
Science has no goal and requires no ideological commitment.
Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. There is no signal for true novelties that cannot be predicted (no linear model).Science is a bet with no insurance. 
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.
Scientists are crucials should be involved. (rethink this position). 


The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.
The lost role of affects. Value is affect.
