#### **Governance of science and technology policies**     
by Paic A., Viros C. (2019)         
OECD      

Reference: [Paic2019](reference/Paic2019.md)

The neoliberal era of science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) herits from a organization of Science that already has some internal contradictions. It will change it by several political reforms, led by the OECD. First, some aspects are retained or slightly modified. Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs. The linear model is modified to include "tacit knowledge" (another idea of Polanyi): for a good transfer of knowledge, industries and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. Despite the strong trend in public-private collaboration, more is "strongly encouraged".  

The major shift is that the governement should no longer plan what science should do. It should follow what "stakeholders" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain, public and private sector.

In Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processing software and filtering out the majority by an unknown process, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the "ivory tower" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life. Government should be *flexible* because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficient (i.e. all the problems raised by Hayek). 

The second shift is about the design of "mission-oriented" policies to solve grand societal challenges, top-down initiatives responding "to the needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support".

>This is meant to generate increased motivation among the actors – beyond remuneration and academic recognition, the awareness of contributing to a great and noble cause is an incentive for surpassing oneself —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 32) 

The rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councils/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon.

>To engage people. Make them part of the process. And proud to be European. Mark Zuckerberg talked about feeling part of something bigger in a recent speech. He was referring to a well-known story about John F Kennedy. The President visited the NASA space centre and saw a janitor carrying a broom. He walked over and asked what he was doing. And the janitor responded: “Mr President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That’s the kind of purpose I’m referring to. — ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/))

Subjects of "mission-oriented" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality "rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance (...)".

>The large number of instruments and programmes available in most of the strategies studied makes it difficult for users to navigate among them and increases the risk of duplication. Rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance, reduce administrative costs (for participants and programme administrators), and maximise the impact of the strategy put in place. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) 



 
#### Comments 

Whose money? Public money, citizens. Who decides? Stakeholders, that is citizens and the private sector — the state should not interfere, only to be "vigilant".  This is the market of ideas. Offer and demand. Consumers are citizens and the private sector. However, the money comes citizens. The private sector does not invest whatsoever in this mechanism. They only ask which directions to pursue annd use the fruit of research. 

We go back to a market system, but this is not at the scale of Polanyi. Scientists are sellers that respond to the demand of public/industrials.

Two questions:

- Do citizens really decide? 

The role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented.  It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal. 

- Can stakeholders know what is good for them ? 

The market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want. However, there is no problem, "should be monitored vigilantly by governments".  It does not, it is incompatible [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). 

In any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV? (such as the meaning of "islamo-gauchism"). *The scientific activity is against the doxa.* 

#### Idea 



- La confiance entre scientifiques et la population est ébranlée parce que ces derniers, sous la pression de publier, se mettent à faire jouer les "commercial morals" (c'est à dire, mon papier est bon car il est accepté). Dès lors, il découle une énorme crise de reproductibilité et la plupart des choses qui en sorte ne sont pas fiable.  Ils vendent des choses fragiles et font des énormes promesses. 

- Credit import recherche de plus en plus grand pour moins de recherche. 

- La tour d'ivoire est crée par le simple fait de différencier les scientifiques des citoyens. Les sccientifiques sont des citoyens et eds humains qui ont des pensées qui reflètent en partie ceux de la société. La tour d'ivoir est illusoire, elle fait comme-ci ces dderniers étaient neutres et objecctifs, près à travailler sur les sujets qu'on leur pointe du doigts. 

- Innovation is technological, aims at economic growth, and can only impact societies positively. [Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)
