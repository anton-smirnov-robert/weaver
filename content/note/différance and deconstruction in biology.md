According to Stiegler, the *différance* of Derrida is:

>the question of a *process* that, by *deffering* its own accomplishment, *differentiates* itself, this differentiation producing traces, which is also to say, *grammes*, forms of writing and of what Of Grammatology called ‘supplements’. —  [Stiegler2020a](reference/Stiegler2020a.md)

During the irreversible *process* of living, an organism *deffer* death ([principle of variation from physics](note/principle%20of%20variation%20from%20physics.md),[Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). To do so, it *differentiates* itself from its environment, by drawing its own boundaries ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md)). To do so, it *constrains* the thermodynamical flow to produces physico-chemical *traces*, among which is its semi-permeable membrane.

>Le concept de « graphie » a besoin de la trace pour vivre et il implique « comme la possibilité commune à tous les systèmes de communication, l'instance de la _trace instituée_ » (1967 : 68). Lorsqu'on associe la _trace_ au _graphe_ (gestuel, visuel, pictural, musical, verbal), cette trace devient _gramme_ (lettre). À cet instant seulement apparaît le dehors (opposé du dedans), en tant qu' « extériorité spatiale et objective » ([Derrida2019](reference/Derrida2019.md) 1967 : 103).


A ==trace== is a physico-chemical material entity made by an assemblage of smaller ones (usually atoms or small molecules). It obeys the second law of thermodynamic (in any large enough closed system) and is therefore doomed to disappear if not maintained on the timescale of its degradation. 

A ==graphe== is an abstract (or fictitiously immutable — i.e. that does not follow the second law) form which is *required* to build physico-mathematical structures (a square for a box, a point for an object, a network that maitains interactions, etc.). 

A ==*grammē*== — or a ==*constraint*== — is a form of writing the biological models. It is a graphe embodied in a trace. If the graphe is playing a role in a physico-mathematical structures, the process by which the abstract object is materialized so that the question of its existence and maintenance is raised, is called *deconstruction*. 

==The deconstruction of biophysical models leads to the principle of organization and the closure of constraints.==

This hierarchy between traces and constraints is only *local* because a trace can also constrain a process. 
An organism differentiates differently depending on the context.
Another aspect of deconstruction is to find justification for the parameters that are used. 
Don't take for granted the use of specific values of parameters that allow you to write down the physical system or boundary/initial conditions. 


### Deconstruction of formal grammars and the closure of *grammes*. 

The deconstruction of formal grammars amounts to materializing symbols.
A set of sentences, as material traces that belong to a language, is produced by assembling letters (atoms) from a irreducible alphabet according to production rules (physical laws). 
The assemblage of atoms requires non-terminal symbols (according to production rules), which are graphes that must be materialized in deconstructing formal grammars. 
If non-terminal symbols cannot be in the alphabet, how to materialize them? Can a materialized language exist?  Not on its own!
This can be explained as a closure of *grammē*, where languages (set of sentences) exist *because* they have a function: the one of being the trace of non-terminal symbols, that is *grammes*. 

In other words, languages exist because they have a function: the one of being able to generate one another.
