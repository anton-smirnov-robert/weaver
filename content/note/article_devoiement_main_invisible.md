5 indicators:
- external perturbation causes research for a precise goal, for offer to meet demand, react quickly to change.
- partition and division of labor (no overlap, no conflict -Morin-, no synthesis). 
- scientists are seen as Smith's inert human (not enough motivated, they are lazy, workforce, not enough risks and vocabulary). We need artificial competition between them (Darwin), management (give them a goal) etc...
- proletarization of scientists who are 
1) desubjectivized, considered as noise for a purely empirical work (new positivism). An empty virgin receptacle for communication via standardized information channels.
3) they lose their capacity to design the projects they want to work upon: it is given the mechanism of the market (the demand of citizen, public what they should look for). 
4) no reflexivity on its work (history, philosophy, epistemology, theory of discipline and science)
5) uses "commerical morals" (reproductability, Goodhart's law) and false promises (Audétat), "sell your research" and avoid complexity
- confusion between objectity and automaticity 
6) automaticity of design (taking the mean, no commitment, entropy)
7) automaticity by protocolization (only what is operational is kept in theories)
8) technique and automaticity is how problems are solved (naive view of robots [Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md) )

Un mot sur les dangers : les scientifiques sont leurs propre autorité. La prolètarization des scientifiques est la fin de la science.

Science has no goal and requires no ideological commitment.
Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. There is no signal for true novelties that cannot be predicted (no linear model).
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.
Science is a bet with no insurance. 
Théorie des communs? Une connaissance vient toujours d'une autre connaissance. 
The lost role of affects. Value is affect.
