## From F. Hayek to M. Polanyi : the distinction between a market system and the Republic of Science. 

### Hayek's market system  ([literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)).

##### Hayek's contribution is identifying the mechanism of the market system
Briefly, we sketch the essence of a market organization Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

>(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)

##### Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes 
According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. In practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book *The Road to Serfdom* —, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.

##### Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors
How, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones. The more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market _self-regulation_.

##### The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)
The decentralized plans of _self-interested actors_ — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the _competition_ for Hayek. It therefore possesses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (as he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” In short,

>The problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 11) 


### Polanyi's Republic of Science ([literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md))

Micheal Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Micheal originally was a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a closed friend of Friedrich Hayek ([Fischer2009](reference/Fischer2009.md)). Michael also made important contributions in philosophy and epistemology. In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, his model is *market-inspired*. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)), because it has a *higher principle*. 


##### Science is made by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives. 

Polanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. By demonstrating that the most efficient way to organize the latter is by a _mutual adjustement of independent initiatives_, he concludes that it is also the most efficient way to organize the former[^1]. While Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchanged information between scientists (the pieces of the puzzle) are scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey unambiguous instructions to reach a known goal (consume more or less of this item to make offer meet demand).

##### Self-interested scientists refer to the scientific standards

However, scientists do maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest _problem_ given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, as a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the _scientific standards:

1.  Plausibility
2.  Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.
3.  Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists

##### The authority is enforced by the scientists themselves

The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. The authority is very important because it also decides where grants and material ressources should be allocated on the same basis of the scientific standards interpretation by scientists. 

##### The tension of scientific standards is the source for the evolution of Science

Moreover, the first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too.

>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  



## OECD comes into play: from the invisible hand to the implicit model.  ([literature note on Henriques2013](note/literature%20note%20on%20Henriques2013.md))

#### Science become too important to be left to an invisible hand
In the 60's, several reasons bring experts to lean over science and technologies (S&T) policies for the first time. First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer: 

>[!quote]
>
>If governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. (OECD, 1966: 8) — Government and Technical Innovation, Paris: OECD.

This input/output continuous model being *de facto* extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good. 

Second, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two blocs threats each other with nuclear weapon. There is a need for being able to plan research activities. 

Third, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md), [Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. The market cannot anticipate what is good for societies, such as research should be funded by public institutions. 

#### The OECD led the international transformation of science
In this context, and based on those arguments, the OECD changed its role, which so far consisted in sharing good practices and tested policies among its members.  It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S&T led by a group of experts. The model it constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). 

#### The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth
The OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needssome fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate resources on specific research area. Accordingly, quantitative indicators must be developed to assess to quality of science and refine policies: this is the birth of the Frascati manual, still in used nowadays.  


## Frankenstein's invisible hand pushing scientists towards green, sustainable economic growth ([literature note on Paic2019](note/literature%20note%20on%20Paic2019.md))


The neoliberal era of science ([Nedeva2006](reference/Nedeva2006.md),[Davies2006](reference/Davies2006.md),[Mirowski2011](reference/Mirowski2011.md),[Lazebnik2018](reference/Lazebnik2018.md)) herits from a organization of Science that already has some internal contradictions. It will change it by several political reforms, led by the OECD. First, some aspects are retained or slightly modified. Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs. The linear model is modified to include "tacit knowledge" (another idea of Polanyi). For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (researcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better. Despite the strong trend in public-private collaboration, more is "strongly encouraged".  


The major shift is that the governement should no longer plan what science should do. It should follow what "stakeholders" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain, public and private sector.

>Commitment at the highest level of government is a crucial means to send a signal to all stakeholders. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 5) 

In Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processig software and filtering out the majority by an unknown proecss, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the "ivory tower" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life. Government should be *flexible* because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficcient (i.e. all the problems raised by Hayek). 

The second shift is about the design of "mission-oriented" policies to solve grand societal challenges, top-down initiatives responding "to the needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support".  The rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councis/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon.

>To engage people. Make them part of the process. And proud to be European. Mark Zuckerberg talked about feeling part of something bigger in a recent speech. He was referring to a well-known story about John F Kennedy. The President visited the NASA space centre and saw a janitor carrying a broom. He walked over and asked what he was doing. And the janitor responded: “Mr President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That’s the kind of purpose I’m referring to. — ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/))

Subjects of "mission-oriented" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality "rationalising and simplifying the programmes, limiting the number of calls and proposing a single “window” for users are ways to enhance efficiency in the granting of finance (...)". 




## Principles for a new Science

- The market needs an exogeous cause to change its prices. Once the market has operated those changes, the prices stop evolving, an equilibrium has been reached. In practice, external events perturbing the cost of one commodity do occur all the time so that everything happen _as if_ prices were evolving because commodities were traded.
- The puzzle metaphor clearly points to a cumulative view of knowledge.
- Polanyi's identifies what [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) would call the dialogical nature of the scientific standards, that is the association of two complementary and antagonistic logics (conformism and dissent here). The duality can be traced back to the constitution of science which both requires verification and common sense contestation. Morin's dialogical principle insists on the non-resolution of the conflicts in the larger entity. It is the active organization of the actions carried out following both logics that constitutes whole entity and not an efficient action that would follow an effective logic, one where conflicts are resolved. In Morin's spirit, the dialogical constrain of the scientific standards transform the circularity of the abovementionned feedback loop into a growing spiral.
- Polanyi identifies a second feedback loop which depicts a process that happens on longer time scale: the transmission of the _appreciation_ of the scientific standards from generations to generations. He therefore also note the _historicity_ of the scientific opinion. Scientific standards change because what scientist acknowledge as plausible,valuable, original research change with the scientific opinion[^2]. This will later be pointed out to be more general by other authors that introduce notions related to [Foucault's épistémè](concept/Foucault's%20épistémè.md). 
- The linear model of science is incompatible with revolutions in science ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)). 
- This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions. It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity. 
- Without overlap, there is no conflict (partition leads to "cemeteries" of ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)) . See also [Morin1982](reference/Morin1982.md) with what needs to be preserve "pluralité conflictuelle de théories sur des arguments empirico-logique"
- Les scientifiques ne prennent pas assez de risques et ne sont pas assez motivés (management)
- division of labour. 
- preconceived objectives given from outside. 
- Respond to demand. Respond quickly to change. 
- C'est comme le patient qui remplace le médecin.  



4 indicators:

- external perturbation causes research for a precise goal, for offer to meet demand, react quickly to change via standardized information channels.
- partition and division of labor (no overlap, no conflict, no synthesis). 
- proletarization of scientists who are 
1) desubjectivized, a part of taskforce considered as noise for a purely empirical work. An empty virgin receptacle for communication.
2) not enough motivated, they are lazy (artificial competition between them, management)
3) lose their design capacity to the mechanism of the market (the demand)
4) lose of objectivity and ignorance of its condition (history, philosophy, epistemology of discipline)
- confusion between objectity and automaticity 
5) automaticity of design (taking the mean, no commitment, entropy)
6) automaticity by protocolization (only what is operational is kept in theories)
7) technique and automaticity is how problems are solved (naive view of robots)


Science has no goal and requires no ideological commitment.
Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. True novelties cannot be predicted. There is no signal for something that cannot be predicted.
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.
Science is a bet with no insurance.


[^1]: Picture helpers solving a large puzzle. Everyone has access to all pieces and independently solve the puzzle based on the pieces already in place. When a piece is added, it unlock new possibilities to everyone, hence the continued mutual adjustement. Splitting the puzzle in zones (disciplines) and the pile of pieces accordingly make the procedure more efficient, but the gist of the idea remains the same in all zones.
[^2]:  Amusingly, to illustrate this point Polanyi reports that projects testing “extrasensory perception” or “once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters” would be discredited. Nowadays, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is under the spotlight and such studies are not _a priori_ discredited.
