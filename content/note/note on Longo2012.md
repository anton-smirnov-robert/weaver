#### The central dogma of biology was formulated during the thriving era of computer programs.
The concepts of [computability](concept/computability.md) and the one of the elaboration of information (reading, writing) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developed in 1930-1936. In 1944, [Schrodinger's code-script aperiodic crystal](concept/Schrodinger's%20code-script%20aperiodic%20crystal.md) first hint at *informational* content in chromosomes in 1944 ([Schrodinger1944](reference/Schrodinger1944.md)). The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after this flourishing era of computation and [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) of molecular biology explained [Mendelian inheritance](concept/Mendelian%20inheritance.md) with the four bases discovered in the DNA in terms of transmission of information from DNA to proteins.

#### The informational metaphor prompts biologist to think about biological phenomena in terms of programs.
[Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) relies on an informational metaphor and states linear causation from the DNA to the proteins. However, it is a misleading metaphor because it forces the way to think about biological problems. Indeed, most biologists see the genome as the "program" for producing proteins. This view ignore the materiality of living organisms, because the software should works on all hardwares in this framework. For instance, Maynard-Smith (that tries to explicitate the notion of information in biology without managing to distinguish Turing and Shannon's difference between elaboration and transmission of information) states:

#### However, programs rely on a very specific structure of determination...
Programming or encoding/decoding in cryptography implies the writing and reading of **symbols** on **discrete** entities. The concept of [computability](concept/computability.md) requires **identical iterations**, **portability** (software on hardware), **linear causation**, **predictability** (because of discreteness) and therefore implies [Laplacian determinism](concept/Laplacian%20determinism.md). 

#### ...and the concept of information is at best vague in biology
Information is not well-defined in biology, but it also has an ambiguous link with [entropy](definition/entropy.md) that play a major role in biology. Following [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md), information is linked to [negentropy](definition/negentropy.md) as:  `high information = low entropy` . On the other hand, following [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md) and [Chaitin's algorithmic randomness](concept/Chaitin's%20algorithmic%20randomness.md) interpretation, we obtain `low compressibility = high randomnness` . If we now follow two common interpretations, which are `high information = low compressibility`, and  `high randomnness = high entropy`,  we get a contradiction with [Brillouin's relation between entropy and information](concept/Brillouin's%20relation%20between%20entropy%20and%20information.md). Yet, as pointed out by Schrödinger, it seems that organisms manage to "resist" the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md) so nothing is absurd here, but everything is vague. 

#### This structure of determination is an epistemological bias for biologists.
The DNA "software" taken from one cell (the "hardware") is not portable. For example, cloning has a very low success and need to resort to "epigenetics reprogramming" ([Matoba2018](reference/Matoba2018.md)). From this perspective, it is, however, possible for humans to "reprogram" evolution ([Doudna2017](reference/Doudna2017.md), [Longo2021](reference/Longo2021.md)). The informational metaphor encourages the observer to think in terms of discrete entities. However, there is no Turing's architect and robust, iterative steps.  Yet, molecules play the role of discrete entities containing information. The arguments use the vocabulary such as "signals", "activator-receptor", or "docking".  However, the use of the notion of [computability](concept/computability.md) in biology cannot account for continuous shape deformation. Therefore, continuous shapes are not considered.  Moreover, what is present along with an informational content but cannot be digitally encoded in signs is inherently considered as noise in [Shannon's theory of information transmission](concept/Shannon's%20theory%20of%20information%20transmission.md).  It therefore contributes to deteriorate the informational content due to the information-theoretic application of the [second principle of thermodynamics](concept/second%20principle%20of%20thermodynamics.md).

>If a wire or a computer are compressed, pulled or twisted, these actions will not increase the information that they are transmitting or elaborating, neither in practice nor in principle. —  ([Longo2012](reference/Longo2012.md), p. 6) 

 For example, [Anfinsen's dogma](concept/Anfinsen's%20dogma.md) has narrowed the research activity regarding the [protein folding problem](concept/protein%20folding%20problem.md). Moreover, [Crick's central dogma](concept/Crick's%20central%20dogma.md) suggests that isogenic cells are identical whereas protein and mRNA copy numbers vary from cell to cell, and are uncorrelated in the same cell ([Taniguchi2010](reference/Taniguchi2010.md)).  Biomechanical forces (themodynamics forces, tensions, stresses) are therefore ignored in this framework, although crucial. There is no space and time in this framework.
