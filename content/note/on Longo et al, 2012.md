## Section 

**DNA was discovered in times that proned an informational metaphor for biological organization**. The discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson in 1953 happened just after an flourishing era of mathematical logic and computation. The concepts of (hardware and software-independent) [computable](definition/computable.md), elaboration of information (reading and programming) with [Turing machine](concept/Turing%20machine.md)s were developped in 1930-1936. At the end of WW2 (were cryptography played a major role), [[Schr√∂dinger's code-script aperiodic crystal]] hints at informational encoding in chromosomes, such as *programs*. In 1948, [[Shannon's theory of information transmission]], which is still crucial nowadays also poped up. The informational metaphor for biological organization (without the hypothesis of the abstract model of mathematical logic) laid out the groundwork for a simplistic explanation of [[Mendel's laws of inheritance]] with the four bases discovered in the DNA. This metaphor is at the core of [[Crick's central dogma]].
