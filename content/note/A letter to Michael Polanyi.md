#### New Principles

Creativit√© et affects. Koff paradox. 
Essential: how entropy feeds the creation of negentropy.
- A novelty should change the phase space. (it is not adapting to).
- They are no laws to drive the search towards. 
- Idea of enablement. 

Science has no goal and requires no ideological commitment.
Science is a tradition, contextual, historical and local. There is no signal for true novelties that cannot be predicted (no linear model).Science is a bet with no insurance. 
Science should deliver technologies with their pharmakological notice.
Scientists are crucials should be involved. (rethink this position). 

Un point d'articulation fondamentale.
Towards marketisation of research. 
Towards an anti-entropic.
Disruption de second-ordre.
Anti-anthropic organization.
