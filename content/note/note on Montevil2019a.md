#### **Possibility spaces and the notion of novelty: from music to biology**

### Introduction

Novelty is used to classify organisms (phylogenetic trees minimize their number to understand ancestors), but they are not properly defined in biology. In maths, everything is given by the hypothesis, all can be deduced from that ? In physics, it is not that straightforward and there is a very weak form of novelty, but it is very different from the biological one.

The paper aims at defining a [novelty](concept/novelty.md) and the concept of [new possibility](concept/new%20possibility.md). 

A novelty is related to a diachronic emergence, in contrast to (synchronic) emergence which is used in physics in complex systems. However, there are diachronic emergence in physics when "new" macroscopic forms emerge (e.g. crystallization). 

This papers wants to provide a better definition of novelties than the one of changing phase space. 

### Bergson's paradox 

We can mathematically define all sheet scores of music. Does it mean all symphonies have been composed yet ? In other words,

### Generic and specific definitions

Three kinds of sets in mathematics: 

$\mathbb{R}$-like: The set is defined, but only a finite number can be defined specifically. Indeed, the probability of having a name for a real number taken randomly is zero. Mathematics or physics can reason on generic variables (e.g. $x^2 \geq 0$). They don't need to define specifically all real numbers to do so.

$\mathbb{N}$-like: The set is defined, and all elements can be defined specifically. However, the set is infinite and therefore it requires generic reasoning (such as a recurrence relation that "propagates"). 

finite set : The set is defined, and we can reason on each element individually. 

Symphonies are finite combinations of finite set of notes, so they are in the $\mathbb{N}$-like category. 

#### Physics restrict the discussion about generic properties of things 

Physics matters about generic **relations** between quantities: it is not about the quantities.

It uses generic initial/boundary conditions or parameters and discuss about them generically (basin of attraction, ranges of parameters, etc.)

Defining a domain of probability means setting all others to 0. Saying that all other situation have probability zero means have a generic reasoning. 

In statistical mechanics, we don't care about a specific configuration where all particles form a ring. Rather, we coarse grain a phase space to generically define a macrostate. 

When bifurcations occur, physics aims at making them generic (period doubling). When they are singular, they do not convey a physical meaning.

In chaotic systems, everything is actually contained in the initial condition. For a fixed dynamical law, it just dig deeper and deeper into it. Nothing is new.


#### Do symphonies share some *relevant* properties ?

What makes symphonies what they are (*relevant* properties), is it a shared property?  
Can we have a generic definition in the set of all music scores for symphonies?
Symphonies share properties, but it is not the properties that makes them what they are.

In machine learning, one can find some relevant properties for some symphonies that have the same composer for instance. But the symphonies pre-exist, their generic properties are not pre-stated. The generic sets (patterns) that are identified are specific to the composer. Novelties in those sets (coming from a convex interpolation), may not be interesting from a musical point of view.


#### The concept of [novelty](concept/novelty.md) is introduced 

DNA and phenotypes are another example. No explicit relations. Gene expression is contextual. DNA cannot discuss the viability of phenotypes. Two different theoretical levels. Even with the idea of a complete genetic determinism (postulated without the generic causal rule — the algorithm) one needs to consider new possibilities. Models of networks, chemical sets do not define possibilities either. 

#### The argument of all-encompassing sets are refutated

Dynamical system of atoms for the organism with determinism. Then novelties are to be found in the specific initial conditions. But they do not define explicit biological possibility. 

All-encompassing sets are also compatible with the notion of novelty. 

#### Weak novelty in physics

It comes from symmetry breaking. Cooled down Ising spins choose a random direction to orient. Novelty ? 

- The novelty is a choice, you can prestate the possibilities (angle)
- It can be repeated *ad libidum*
- The novelty has to appear at a given threshold
- It is ponctual so transition phase are elementary (binary)
- Equation at the microscopic level does not change 
- Macroscopic possibilities are finite, small in number, they can be predicted after investigation
- Anhistorical system, so that novelties does not impact the future dynamic 

Actual possibilities can be understood by the relations between the parts before the possibility is actualized. 
Virtual possibilities do not follow the causal relations requires to understand the initial sitution. 

#### The concept of [new possibility](concept/new%20possibility.md) in biology is nedeed

It is argued that specificity + functionality leads to historicity and therefore the idea of new possibility.
A biological function is specific because it belongs to an organization.
Therefore, it needs the concept of new possibility. 


#### Response to maths objections


Being able to generate a pattern is not being able to explain it, that is to be an explicit possibility. 
It is choosing a good initial condition. 
Be careful with the retrospective illusion : putting a novelty as generic *a posteriori*.
