### Introduction 

About the [history of organisms as self-determined biological systems](note/history%20of%20organisms%20as%20self-determined%20biological%20systems.md). 
Definition of a [biological process](definition/biological%20process.md). 
Definition of a [biological constraint](definition/biological%20constraint.md). 

- The proper symmetries of biological constraints can be broken over time and, therefore, must be actively maintained or rebuilt within the system (which, as we will see, leads to organisational closure) —  (Montévil et Mossio, 2015, p. 9)
