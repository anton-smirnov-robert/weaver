#### Complexity theories form an archipelago
Several grouped studied a form of [complexity](definition/complexity.md). There was the [Groupe des Dix](definition/Groupe%20des%20Dix.md), [complexity sciences](definition/complexity%20sciences.md), but also complexity in informatics (see e.g. [Kolmogorov's incompressibility](concept/Kolmogorov's%20incompressibility.md)). There is no one area, but several and different ones. 

#### Complexity sciences constitute a plateform rather than a discipline
[complexity sciences](definition/complexity%20sciences.md) are not autonomous. They cannot preserve or reproduce their scientific activity in the traditional sense (no courses, no social existence in universities, no specific allocation or comission at CNRS for instance). However, they share theoretical stances, collaborate and recognize each other with topics (chaos, network, emergence, etc.). Scientists are not specialists of complexity, they rather have a **dual role** and complexity appears on their CV in second or third position. It is however more than a mere trend because it lasts throughout time, a community persists. In a nutshell, it is rather a **scientific platform.** 

#### Complexity sciences rely on classical ontologies and epistemologies
Structure of scientific argumentation rely on Ockham's razor, toy modeling, **statistics**, **mathematical modeling**, and proof of concept. [backcasting](definition/backcasting.md) is also often used. Scientists usually assimilate the formal cause (not the material cause) of models to the one of reality, like in physics.
