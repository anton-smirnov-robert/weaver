####  Science become too important to be left to an invisible hand
In the 60's, several reasons bring experts to lean over science and technologies (S&T) policies for the first time. First, science played a decisive role during the two world wars because of the technologies it generated. If technnologies are of national interests, they emerge from reasearch so that the later activity becomes crucial. The so-called linear model for innovation explicit this chain: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. However, following the lines of the OECD at the same period, the linear causal chain is in fact longer:

>If governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. (OECD, 1966: 8) — Government and Technical Innovation, Paris: OECD.

This input/output continuous model being *de facto* extended to economic growth, the goal of the scientific enterprise becomes economic growth. This is still explicitly acknowledged nowadays ([Petit2019](reference/Petit2019.md)). The indisputable positive correlation between ecconomic growth and societies well-beings makes science a precious public good. 

Second, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two blocs threats each other with nuclear weapon. There is a need for being able to plan research activities. 

Third, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md), [Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. The market cannot anticipate what is good for societies, such as research should be funded by public institutions. 

#### The OECD led the international transformation of science
In this context, and based on those arguments, the OECD changed its role, which so far consisted in sharing good practices and tested policies among its members.  It transformed itself into a policy innovator in S&T led by a group of experts. The model it constructed was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to its elaboration whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering widely implemented advices in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is mainly influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). 

#### The model centralizes the planning of science to insure economic growth
The OECD preconized to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France was the only country to already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needssome fields should be prioritized. The discussion is no longer carried out only by scientists and research councils. Every member of the linear chain of innovation is invited to play a role in the decision process, be it industrials or civil society representatives. Following the USA — which, on the other hand, is the exception that never centralized the coordination of science at the governement level —, members of the OECD increasingly introduced project-based competitive fundings to create incentives and concentrate resources on specific research area.

#### Comments

- The linear model of science is incompatible with revolutions in science ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)). 

- This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions. It builds on The Republic of Science and implicitely ackowledges its description of the research activity. However, it
