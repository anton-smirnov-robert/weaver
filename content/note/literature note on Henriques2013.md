In the 60's, several reasons bring experts to lean over science and technologies (S&T) policies for the first time. First, science  had played a decisive role during the two world wars through the technologies it has generated and has therefore become of national importance. The linear model for innovation is dominant: basic research, applied resarch, development and diffusion of technologies. Following the lines of the OECD at the same period:

>If governments succeed in helping to increase the pace of technical innovation, it will facilitate structural changes in the economy, and increase the supply of new and improved products necessary for Member Governments to achieve rapid economic growth and full employment and without inflation. (OECD, 1966: 8) — Government and Technical Innovation, Paris: OECD.

, we understand that this input/output continuous model largely  extends to economic growth — the latter being still the explicit goal of science. Even though, this rationale can be severly criticized — for example by noting that science does make continuous progresses ([Kuhn1970](reference/Kuhn1970.md)) — science is now considered as a precious public good. Second, during the cold war governements found out that science could accomplish geopolitical objectives, such as racing to the moon. Being able to give directions to scientists becomes a matter survival when two blocs threats each other to lunch nuclear weapon. Third, the amount of money flowing through science becomes very large. Also, two economists ([Nelson1959](reference/Nelson1959.md), [Arrow1962](reference/Arrow1962.md)) show that private fundings cannot optimally invest in very risky activities whoses goal is to produce public knowledge. 

In this context, the OECD changed its role. From sharinng good practices of tested policies, it transformed itself into a policy innovator in S&T which a group of experts. The latter was never explicited in a single document and no reference is made to the elaboration of a model whatsoever. The latter needs to be reconstructed by gathering directions in numerous documents spanning several years ([Henriques2013](reference/Henriques2013.md)). It is influenced by a famous american report ([Bush1945](reference/Bush1945.md)) and the work of experts of the OECD ([Piganiol1963](reference/Piganiol1963.md)). 

The OECD preconizes to centralize the coordination of science at the governement level. In three years, the majority of countries of the OECD would have the equivalent of the science minister (France already had one). The agenda of research should now be discussed with the long term national economic objectives and societal needs. Some fields can be prioritized depending on the context. Following the USA, project-based competitive fundings become handy to create incentives and concentrate resources on specific targets.

This is in sharp contrast with the invisible hand that Polanyi described. However, avoiding an explicit model allows to ignore theoretical contridications. Without refuting the existing explicit model, science starts to be inhabited by contradictions...
