### Introduction

Novelty is used to classify organisms (phylogenetic trees minimize their number to understand ancestors), but they are not properly defined in biology. In maths, everything is given by the hypothesis, all can be deduced from that ? In physics, it is not that straightforward and there is a very weak form of novelty, but it is very different from the biological one.

The paper aims at defining a [biological novelty](concept/biological%20novelty.md) and the concept of [new possibility](concept/new%20possibility.md). 

A novelty is related to a diachronic emergence, in contrast to (synchronic) emergence which is used in physics in complex systems. However, there are diachronic emergence in physics when "new" macroscopic forms emerge (e.g. crystallization). 

This papers wants to provide a better definition of novelties than the one of changing phase space. 

### Bergson's paradox 

We can mathematically define all sheet scores of music. Does it mean all symphonies have been composed yet ? In other words,
