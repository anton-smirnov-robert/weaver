#### Kant (teleology)
In 1790, Immanuel Kant refers to biological systems as self-organising entities, but struggles to reconcile teleology and mechanical physics. ([Kant1790](reference/Kant1790.md))
#### Claude Bernard (physiology)
Claude Bernard wants to detach himself from vitalists ([Bernard1865](reference/Bernard1865.md), [Bernard1879](reference/Bernard1879.md)). 
He introduces the notion of *milieu* and distinguishes the internal and external *milieu* of biological systems. 
The internal milieu *self-determines* (all components contribute to the realisation of the conditions in which all other components can exist) and is stable despite the variations of the external milieu. 
#### Cannon (homeostatis)
Homeostasis: the capability of actively compensating for environmental perturbations through a coordinated physiological action. ([Cannon1929](reference/Cannon1929.md))
#### Wiener and Ashby (cybernetics)
Homeostasis is mathematically expressed in terms of feedback loops by first-order Cybernetics. ([Wiener1948](reference/Wiener1948.md), [Ashby1957](reference/Ashby1957.md) )
### Waddington and Weiss
Specific application of cybernetics for biological process (canalisation of "molecular self-organisation", with "quasi-finalistic" process).  [Weiss1968](reference/Weiss1968.md),
