#### **What makes biological organisation teleological?**     
by Mossio M., Bich L. (2014)         
*Synthese* 194: 1089-1114

First, a brief [pre-note on the organicist tradition](note/pre-note%20on%20the%20organicist%20tradition.md).

Teleological organization means that the activity of the organization is oriented towards an end (see also [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md)). It has a *telos* in contrasts to physical systems. It can be extrinsic (for artefacts) and intrinsic for biological systems. The telos of biological systems is to establish and maintain their own conditions of existence. 

The main argument is that:

where self-constraint should be understood as [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md). Also:

Most importantly: not all circular causation mean self-constraint (water cycle for instance). For instance, a river does not specify its external boundary conditions (the water bed):

Natural selection is teleological (like geodesics) but it relies on individuals capacity to adapt and therefore another teleology of the organisms. 

Homeostatis, wich is explicited by Cybernetics, lacks the crucial aspect of adaptativity beyond regulation within a predefined interval. 

Varela et Maturana ([Maturana1973](reference/Maturana1973.md)) support that biological systems have no telos, but this is mainly to distinguish from genocentrism. 

What about autocatalytic sets or other form of non-biological systems that make closure of constraint? Either they have nothing tot do with biological system or they are nearly biological systems. It may require some additional thought but we are again looking at frontiers.
