#### **Governance of science and technology policies**

What happen if a purely liberal model of science — building on the invisible hand picture "that guides scientists towards an unknown direction" — is hijacked by centralizing science coordination and planning towards a precise goal? This question is interesting, but a better one is: what happens if this pardoxal situation is now given to neoliberals? Should they follow the ideas of their founding fathers or is the ability to push science towards a direction too tempting? 

Some aspects are retained or slightly modified: 

- Using the historical argument that the market cannot invest optimally, money should come from the state. 
- International competitivity is an other goal of science that adds to economic growth and answering societal needs.

Some aspects are transformed: 

- The linear model is no longer valid, it is the "tacit knowledge" (another idea of Polanyi) that cannot be transferred in the linear model of innovation. For a good transfer of knowledge, industry and universities should co-create and collaborate. The closer all actors (reasearcher, industrials, citizens) are, the better.

>Greater public-private collaboration in R&D is strongly encouraged. (...) This is a strong trend, observed in all of the cases studied—  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 31) 

- The state should no longer plan science. It should follow what "stakeholders" — a name whose merit is to be enlightning — demand or need. The later refers to the same actors in the innovation chain.

In Netherlands, citizens ask online their scientific questions. After gathering them out thanks to a word-processig software and filtering out the majority by an unknown proecss, the remaining questions are then defined as a scientific priorities. The idea is to dispel the "ivory tower" of scientists, making them play a role in daily life.

- It should be flexible because sometimes decision processes are long, and knowledge is not perfect, and it is difficult to react quickly to contextual evolutions. In other words, centralization is rather inefficcient.

>Policy development sometimes requires consultations and long consensus-building processes, but parallel working groups and ad hoc committees must have room to manoeuvre in order to react more quickly to contextual evolutions. —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 33) 

- "Mission-oriented" policies should be designed to solve grand societal challenges.

>They are top-down initiatives responding to needs that are perceived as urgent by society (societal challenges), with strong political support (which has both advantages and disadvantages). —  (Paic et Viros, 2019, p. 12) 

Beyond being short-term projects with predetermined results, there is an aim at managing scientists efforts.

Examples such as nuclear energy, or conquest of space are given. It seems that the ideology of all scientists is also fixed. Do all scientists need to believe that we should "conquer space". Is there an ideological engagement when making basic research?  Other examples are green growth for instance. First, one should endorse the idea that it is a good and real thing (Tordjman). There is a ideaological commitment in being a scientist.

>To engage people. Make them part of the process. And proud to be European. Mark Zuckerberg talked about feeling part of something bigger in a recent speech. He was referring to a well-known story about John F Kennedy. The President visited the NASA space centre and saw a janitor carrying a broom. He walked over and asked what he was doing. And the janitor responded: “Mr President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That’s the kind of purpose I’m referring to. — ([Carlos Moedas](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/lamy-report-ensuring-inspirational-research/34970/))

The rationale is given by the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation of the European Commission from 2014-2019. His nuanced and elaborate view of science reflects his profound implication for research that he has cultivated at Goldman Sachs and other councis/investment and insurance firms, and now as mayor of Lisbon. 

- Subjects of "mission-oriented" and more generally projects should not to overlap to optimize the allocated funds. This is the scientific organisation of scientific work to reach optimality. 




#### Comments 

Whose money? Public money, citizens. Who decides? Stakeholders, that is citizens and the private sector — the state should not interfere, only to be "vigilant".  This is the market of ideas. Offer and demand. Consumers are citizens and the private sector. However, the money comes citizens. The private sector does not invest whatsoever in this mechanism. They only ask which directions to pursue annd use the fruit of research. 

We go back to a market system, but this is not at the scale of Polanyi. Scientists are sellers that respond to the demand of public/industrials.


Two questions:

- Do citizens really decide? 

The role of stakeholders is primoridial. It is highly questionnalble that the civil society is well-represented.  It appears that large multinational group give up on research to focus on academic papers or start-ups emerging from the academy. Are the topics of academic research defined by industries so that they can externalize their research activity to the academy? Would it be the case, this would be a *pillage* of public funds. With public funds, industries would finance their research activities (externalized in academy) in order to grow. They would indeed builds societies if they convince the state that it is what citizens want. This recalls the McKinsey scandal. 

- Can stakeholders know what is good for them ? 

The market system (offer and demand), but the directives are given by stakeholders. The state gives money (public money). In other words, citizens pay taxes for financing public research. Public research should work on what they want. The state should hear what they need and want and point to scientists in which directions should they work. However, citizens benefit from science via technological innovations. Industries therefore play a role in the disccussion. They can tell the state what citizens want or will want. However, there is no problem, "should be monitored vigilantly by governments".  It does not, it is incompatible [Blok2015](reference/Blok2015.md). 

In any case, the money comes from citizens. So either citizens should say where their money should go to. Do citizens know what they want? Should politics ask scientists what to look for according to what goes on on TV? (such as the meaning of "islamo-gauchism"). *The scientific activity is against the doxa.* 

#### Idea 

- We gave up on the idea that science is a creative activity, and we cannot determine what will happen and what can be useful. Nothing can be created. How to engage that without any garuantee. 
Empirical research with automation of protocoles aims at eliminating everything that can be creative. We want to predefine what will be obtained. Purely empirical investigations negates that human plays a role in constructing theories. What want to control what to look for and why. Important scientific results come from unexpected results. We cannot predict, but need to trust this. As long as we cannot trust the fact that something can emerge from nothing. Being is being determined. Nothing can be created.  

- La confiance entre scientifiques et la population est ébranlée parce que ces derniers, sous la pression de publier, se mettent à faire jouer les "commercial morals" (c'est à dire, mon papier est bon car il est accepté). Dès lors, il découle une énorme crise de reproductibilité et la plupart des choses qui en sorte ne sont pas fiable.  Ils vendent des choses fragiles et font des énormes promesses. 

- Credit import recherche de plus en plus grand pour moins de recherche. 

- La tour d'ivoire est crée par le simple fait de différencier les scientifiques des citoyens. Les sccientifiques sont des citoyens et eds humains qui ont des pensées qui reflètent en partie ceux de la société. La tour d'ivoir est illusoire, elle fait comme-ci ces dderniers étaient neutres et objecctifs, près à travailler sur les sujets qu'on leur pointe du doigts. 

- Innovation is technological, aims at economic growth, and can only impact societies positively. [Blok2015a](reference/Blok2015a.md)
