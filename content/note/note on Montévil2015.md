First, the authors tell a brief [history of self-determination](note/history%20of%20self-determination.md). They define a [biological process](definition/biological%20process.md), a [biological constraint](definition/biological%20constraint.md), a [dependence between constraints](definition/dependence%20between%20constraints.md). Finally they introduce the concept of [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md).

The authors argue that the capacity of biological systems to self-determine should be understood as their capacity to self-constrain: organize by realizing a [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md). 
They also argue that [closure of constraints](concept/closure%20of%20constraints.md) grounds [biological function](concept/biological%20function.md)s. 

Because biological systems are thermodynamically open, closure in a *context-dependent determination.* However, to  describe closure we need to abstract the system from the physical time in which process occur because they are multiscale in time (and space).

>(...) the specificity of biological systems lies in their capacity for self-determination as self-constraint. As discussed above, the central idea is that self-constraint occurs in biological systems in the form of closure, i.e. a causal regime in which a set of mutually dependent constraints act on the flows of energy and matter so as to collectively maintain themselves, and their organisation, over time. In turn, the fundamental formal distinction between the two regimes of causation at work (constraints and processes) relies on the identification of symmetries, and local conservations, at the relevant (temporal) scales. —  ([Montevil2015](reference/Montevil2015.md), p. 25)
