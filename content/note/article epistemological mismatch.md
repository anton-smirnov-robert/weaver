## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. 
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process.

## Definition of a mechanistic organization

## Today's research through the prism of mecanization 


### The shortest history of science
Research activities carried out before the 60's were convincingly described by Polanyi using market-inspired models. The Republic of Science operates a clear distinction between Hayek's market mechanism. The first implementations of science policies by the members of the OECD were carried out in the mid-60's. It quickly led to centralization at the governement level of science and technology coordination and planning. Research has a goal: it is the economic growth, via technological innovations. The absence of an explicit policy model makes Polanyi's Republic of Science unrefuted and implicitly valid, hence a profound theoretical contradiction. The ideology of science policy makers shifted towards neoliberalism at the turn of the XXth century. One could have expected the decentralization of Science, and the implementation of a faithful Republic of Science. Instead, a "commited" and "flexible" government is now canalizing public funds towards (ideologically constrained) directions "stakeholders" (private sectors and citizens) feel relevant. To make offer meet demand, we therefore assist to a marketization and industrialisation of research.

## Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
