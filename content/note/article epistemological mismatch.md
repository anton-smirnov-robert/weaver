## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. 
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process. 

## Introduction

## Definition of a mechanistic system and organization

## Application to Hayek's market system 

[literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)

We sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). 

The state of economic actors is described by their variable amount of consumption and production of goods. The state of goods are described by their variable price (T2). The finite matrix of economic actors and their relation with goods is predefined, and their state variables are all positive decimals (T3). Isolated from the system, actors have nothing to buy or sell and their state cannot change (T4).

Consumers can act by changing their relative consumption of goods depending on their personal inclinations and the variation of prices. Producters can alter the relative price of commodities depending on their varying capacity to produce them and the evolution of their consumption. The inclination to consume or produce is part of their personal "knowledge", reduced to a set of intrinsic parameters for each actor (T1). The access to the information of prices is also part of this intrinsic "knowledge". Prices channel information between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives instructions if one act so as to maximizes its own interest (T5). 

For Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actor and posseses an extensive aspect (more sellers and consumers). For "knowledge" to be efficiently used, decentralization (or competition) should be maximized (T6) and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation.

This very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md). A detailed account for the limitations of similar models in economic can be found in ([Koppl2015](reference/Koppl2015.md)) and references therein. 

## Application to Polanyi's Republic of Science

[literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md)

In the Republic of Science, scientists (T5) maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources (T1) — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve.

When a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the dialogical scientific standards (plausability, scientific value, originality). The first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. 

The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. 

The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. 

The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too.

>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  


 

#### Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
