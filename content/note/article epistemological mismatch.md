## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. 
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process. 

## Introduction

## Application to Hayek's market system

We sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). 

The state of economic actors is described by their variable amount of consumption and production of goods. The state of goods are described by their variable price (T2). The finite matrix of economic actors and their relation with goods is predefined, and their state variables are all positive decimals (T3). Isolated from the system, actors have nothing to buy or sell and their state cannot change (T4).

Consumers can act by changing their relative consumption of goods depending on their personal inclinations and the variation of prices. Producters can alter the relative price of commodities depending on their varying capacity to produce them and the evolution of their consumption.
The inclination to consume or produce refers to the personal "knowledge" that is reduced to a set of intrinsic parameters for the parts (T1). In order to make offer meet demand, one act so as to maximizes its own interest (T5). Offer will meet demand to reach an equilibrium as long as the field of vision — accessibility to the information of prices — of individuals sufficiently overlap. 

For Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actor and posseses an extensive aspect (more sellers and consumers). For knowledge not to inefficiently used in a centralization process, one should maximize decentralization (or competition) when designing markets (T6) and do not alter the prices flexibilies. 

We conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md). 

## Application to Polanyi's Republic of Science

#### Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
