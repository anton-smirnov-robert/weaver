## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. 
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process. 


## Hayek's mechanistic economy of knowledge 

[literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)

We sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). For this reason, the organization should keep knowledge decentralized. 

A finite set of economic actors are all inclined to consume or produce a various finite sets of goods. This parametrizes their field of visions which need to overlap one another (T1). The state of those actors is described by their variable consumption and production of goods. The state of the latter is their variable price (T2), but their flexibility is parametrized.

To reach the equilibrium of the global economy, local actors only need to differentiate their local consumption or production of goods. Hayek's main idea is that to know in what way to do it, they only need their personal knowledge — "which by its nature cannot (...) be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form" — and an additional shared information, a price, that couple them to the rest of the economy. Alone, or without prices, an economic actor does not receive any information and she does not change her production or consumption: her state is inertial (T3). When goods have prices that can be changed by producters, if (and only if) economic actors act to maximize their profit, the variation of prices become instructions that determine the actions of individuals and regulate the economy[^1] (T4). For instance, if the price of a commodity of one's interest increases, one reduces its consumption of it and buy more of similar but different one. 

For Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actors. For knowledge to be the most efficiently used, competition should be maximized and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation (T6). 

This very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md). 

## Polanyi's Republic of Science

[literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md)

Michael Polanyi is to be distinguished from his older brother Karl. Even in both have made considerable contributions in economics, Michael was first of all a physical chemist. Karl is well known for his critiques of self-regulating markets. In contrast, Michael was a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society and a close friend of Hayek. In the Republic of Science, Polanyi (i.e. Michael for now on) explicitly acknowledges being inspired by Adam Smith's “invisible hand”. However, he underlines that the scientific organization cannot be reduced to the mechanisms of the market as defined by Hayek. Let's understand why. 

Polanyi's original idea arises from comparing science as the activity that consists in collectively assembling pieces of a giant and unknown puzzle. This metaphor comes with a cumulative view of knowledge that we will endorse here: discoveries are made when you work hard enough to unturn stones. This implies a space of potential discoveries in which some of them have already been made. (see Fig.1) 

The state of explorers can be defined on the frontier of the known discoveries subspace. Indeed, researchers maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve. Therefore, when a new discovery is made, an explorer adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the *scientific standards:

1. Plausibility
2. Scientific value, that is accuracy, systematic importance and the interest in the subject matter.
3. Originality, which is the degree of surprise caused by the discovery among scientists

Scientific standards associate two complementary and antagonistic logics: stability and variation (or "conformism" and "dissent"). This duality shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority that encourages its subversion. This aspect make sciences historical because the scientific opinion change throughtout time and therefore so does the interpretation of the scientific standards by researchers. This prevents a differential law of evolution to be valid once for all. The shape of the puzzle change throughout time and this constraints the directions explorers look at. 

The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists (or "overlapping neighborhoods") allow them to enforce the authority of the scientific standards when articles are submitted, by the peer-review process. The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals that endorse each other. 

While Polanyi is inspired by the price mechanism, he underlines that the exchange of information between scientists is made by scientific papers and not prices; the former do not convey instructions to reach a known goal. Explorers don't need discoveries to work per se — they give them a better directions to look at — so they are not inert when left alone.

>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  
 

#### Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
