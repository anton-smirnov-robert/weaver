## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic organization to sniff out Holton's themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polayni's Republic of Science, and an OECD model reconstituated from Science & Technology policy papers are analyzed within that respect. 
I relate some reported issues in the academic community to a mechanization of scientific research, and introduce the concept of *epistemological mismatch*. 

### Introduction
 

#### Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
