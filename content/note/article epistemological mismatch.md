## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. 
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process. 

## Introduction

## Definition of a mechanistic system and organization

## Application to Hayek's market system 

[literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)

We sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). Therefore, the organization should maximize *decentralization* (T6). 

Economic actors are generically defined as consumers or producters. Their specific knowledge "which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form", is expressed as a price which can be written on a generic physical substrate, hence T1.  The list of goods is fixed so that economic aactors ana list their consumption or producter 

and that varies within a predefined set of possibilities, namely the positive decimals (T2). 

For economic actors to adapt to changes, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their differential consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different ones.

>It is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment —  (Hayek, 1945, p. 8) 

The more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hamper the market _self-regulation_.

#### Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
