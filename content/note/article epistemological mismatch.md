## **Abstract**

I posit five characteristics of a mechanistic system to sniff out (Holton's) themata related to machines in proposals to organize living beings, such as humans. 
Hayek's market system, Polanyi's Republic of Science, and a reconstituated OECD policy model of science are analyzed within that respect. 
I argue that the organization of scientific research is being mechanized and relate diagnozed symptomes of distress of the community to this process. 


## Hayek's mechanistic economy of knowledge 

[literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)

We sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). For this reason, the organization should keep knowledge decentralized. 

A finite set of economic actors are all inclined to consume or produce a various finite sets of goods. This parametrizes their field of visions which need to overlap one another (T1). The state of those actors is described by their variable consumption and production of goods. The state of the latter is their variable price (T2), but their flexibility is parametrized.

To reach the equilibrium of the global economy, local actors only need to differentiate their local consumption or production of goods. Hayek's main idea is that to know in what way to do it, they only need their personal knowledge — "which by its nature cannot (...) be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form" — and an additional shared information, a price, that couple them to the rest of the economy. Alone, or without prices, an economic actor does not receive any information and she does not change her production or consumption: her state is inertial (T3). When goods have prices that can be changed by producters, if (and only if) economic actors act to maximize their profit, the variation of prices become instructions that determine the actions of individuals and regulate the economy[^1] (T4). For instance, if the price of a commodity of one's interest increases, one reduces its consumption of it and buy more of similar but different one. 

For Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actors. For knowledge to be the most efficiently used, competition should be maximized and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation (T6). 

This very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md). 

## Polanyi's Republic of Science

[literature note on Polanyi1962](note/literature%20note%20on%20Polanyi1962.md)

In the Republic of Science, scientists (T5) maximize the merit they may obtain by tackling the toughest problem given their limited amount of material and intellectual resources (T1) — they naturally never tackle problems that are far too hard for them to solve.

When a new article update a scientist's intellectual ressources, she adjusts her work by referring to the criteria of merit which are the dialogical scientific standards (plausability, scientific value, originality). The first two scientific standards tends to conformity while the third foster dissent. This tension shows the fundamental characteristic of the scientific authority which is a _dynamical orthodoxy,_ that is an orthodoxy that encourages its subversion. 

The overlapping areas of expertise between specialized scientists allow them to control those criteria when articles are submitted. The authority of the scientific standards is therefore enforced using _overlapping neighborhoods_. 

The fragmentized _scientific opinion_ is not held by one single person but by a multitude of individuals. 

The dynamical aspect make sciences _traditional_: science is transmitted from generation to generation — like arts, moral or legal practices — to young scientists that are trained with a specific part of the current scientific opinion. This makes the evaluation of scientific standards change throughtout time too.

>The Republic of Science shows us an association of independent initiatives, combined towards an indeterminate achievement. It is disciplined and motivated by serving a traditional authority, but this authority is dynamic; its continued existence depends on its constant self-renewal through the originality of its followers. —  ([Polanyi1962](reference/Polanyi1962.md), p. 72)  


 

#### Conclusion
As Holton points out ([Holton1975](reference/Holton1975.md)), a thematic analysis may often be related to its antithetical concept.   
Physical reductivism defined as the belief that "all events which fall under the laws of any science are physical events and hence fall under the laws of physics." ([Fodor1974](reference/Fodor1974.md)). 
We posit that this belief is not at all restricted to phycisists. Indeed, the contrapositive statement may be more deletarious. 
I finally suggest a distopia related to machines
