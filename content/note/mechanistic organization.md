Call a system a set of parts interacting together. 
Call a physical system a system in which parts are made of inanimate objects. 
Call an organization a system which has a *telos*. 
Call a mechanistic organizations (MO) a system organized by a designer having in mind the idea of a machine. 
Machines are therefore physical MOs. 
However, MO can be designed to organize living beings, notably humans. 
I posit that a MO is a system characterized by six traits:

#### F1: Its parts are generic.
Parts can be replaced, leaving the MO invariant by this transformation.
In mechanics, parts are defined by their generic properties 

#### F2: Outside the system, parts are inert. 
A principle should be given. 
In mechanics, Galileo's inertial principle posits that isolated physical objects are immobile in the relevant referential. 

#### F3: The state of parts can vary within a predefined set of possibilities. 
It should be generically or specifically stated[^2].  
In mechanics, phase spaces are the predefined set of possibilities. 
 
#### F4: The action of parts is optimized and/or parts collectively obey a deterministic law.
The action of parts and/or the deterministic law should be stated.
In classical mechanics, the principle of least action gives the geodesic followed by an object. Master equations determine the state of parts collectively. 

#### F5: The system has an extrinsic telos. 
An organization has an *extrinsic* *telos* if it is designed by one or several subjects that do not belong to the system.[^1] 

#### F6: An optimality criterion exists for the nature of parts and/or the number of parts. 
I argue that when a MO is suggested, the designer refers to the most efficient one for a fixed mechanism. Indeed, there exist infinitely many MO completing the same task with varying number of parts[^3]. Also, if the realization of the *telos* can be quantified on a line, MOs can fulfill its task more or less satisfactorily. The most efficient MO for a given task is an abstract object, because we cannot explicit it in general (MOs can complete the same task using different mechanism). However, we can gather MOs by their mechanism — to be understood as its informal description using Occam's razor (the pinciple of parsimony) —, and correctly refer to the suggested MO with the suggested criterion, at fixed level of *telos* completion. 

F1 to F4 characterize systems described with the epistemology of mechanics (which is a branch of physics). F5 and F6 are more specific to organization per se. 


---------- 
[^1]: In contrast, biological organisms have an *instrinsic* *telos*: the one of establishing and maintaining their own conditions of existence. [Mossio2014](reference/Mossio2014.md)
[^2]: Circular organizations (i.e. organizations containing causal circularities) are homeostatic ones: they permit the stability (for instance, using feedback loops) of the organization. In contrast to generative organizations — such as biological ones — there are no intrinsic and imprestatable variations. The absence of a variation/stability duality prevents the adoption of novelties. 
[^3]: Machines must be thermodynamically open systems to operate. Accordingly, mechanistic organizations must be open in some way for relevant ressources to flow in. Performance of MOs could be evaluated by taking into account the number of parts *and* the amount of required ressources. However, we do not characterize MOs with this aspect because i) it refers to a concept or thermodynamics with brings us outside mechanics ii) openess is not an attribute this is restrictive enough to compare organizations.
