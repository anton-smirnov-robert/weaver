Let be a closed system of an organism and a large enough environment so that the organism does not feel this closure.

 Let’s consider that organisms do not interact so we can consider one (or many independent) organisms in the same environment.

My phase space is the position and velocity of all atoms. It is huge. In the framework of classical dynamics, I consider that the motion is deterministic.

If this system represent the reality we see, than we can agree on the fact that the system is highly non-ergodic because not all configurations are explored while I’m living.

In fact, non-ergodic is a too soft statement. In fact, the space is so huge that a trajectory has no chance to come back at the same position. It visits only one time each state on the time scale of the universe.

Therefore, we call it historic.

The variations of the historic system representing the organism follows a deterministic trajectory at the global and fixed physico-mathematical level (organism+env).

However, we are not Laplacian deamons, and we do not know the place and velocities of all particles. Also the precision of our measurements is finite and the system is chaotic.

In practice we have unpredictable variations: I cannot say the future movement of atoms in my body or in the one of a single cell.

Here is a pardox:

Let’s put as an initial state the current position of your atoms and their velocities. You will live for yet another some years, according to the deterministic system that is supposed to represent our reality.

However, I can say that the death configurations are immensly larger that the one where I live.

Following the second principle of thermodynamic (the Boltzman one on configurations), I must die, and actually very quickly.

This is not a paradox but it points to the fact that particles are in a very peculiar place for this to happen ? What is it ?

What can we say about the position and velocity of your atoms that can make us understand how it is possible ?

It is not only about being in a ordered structured, that is to be in a singular place of the phase space.

It is about how do you remain in such a structure, in such tiny zones of the phase space ?

Becomes it has a goal, that is no to be alive, but to remain alive, or to self-maintain, we can sask how are living being organized ?

We look for a mechanistic explanation to justify the thermodynamical remark.

Peculiar zone gives rise to ordered structured, therefore organizations.

How are atoms and molecules of organisms organized so that they stay in very tiny zone of the phase space for relatively long time?

For the phase space perspective, it means that trajectories are trying to be recursive. 

Now, dwelling on a specific zone can be seen from a macroscopic point of view. You can define a coarse-grained area that can be meaningful.

Accordingly, we now that organisms have evolving phenotypes so we now that they go throught several macrospaces.

Therefore we can draw
