The authors start by giving an account of the [Modern Synthesis](concept/Modern%20Synthesis.md).

Today's biology is more sophiticated, but there is no new theoretical framework, just accomodations. Without a proper and consistent understanding, approaches to scientific questions can be biased (too much importance on genes, development and heridity are studied separately). 

Change of the Modern Synthesis have been called for by various actor spaning the last fifty years (e.g., [Whyte1964](reference/Whyte1964.md),[Gilbert1996](reference/Gilbert1996.md), [Noble2014](reference/Noble2014.md)).

Insights can be gained from (relatively) new fields of biology:

- ==**evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo")**== : [gene product](definition/gene%20product.md)s vary with phenotypic variations (timing, location, amount, or nature of genes). Therefore, this circularity makes developmental properties affect evolution of phenotypes. Bias in development can channel towards functional types. 

- ==**phenotypic plasticity**== : phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of an organism to change its phenotype in response to the environment. It can involve a subsequent genetic accomodation through stabilization of this change. 

- ==**inclusive inheritance**== : transmission is not only of DNA, but also of post-fertilization rersources (e.g. hormones), behavioral interactions with parents, symbionts with mother's germ cells.

- ==**niche construction**== : refers to the process whereby the metabolism, activities and choices of organisms modify or stabilize environmental states, and thereby affect selection acting on themselves and other species. 

The authors propose to take into account those aspects with **reciprocal causation**, a very poor and undefined concept to describe the circularity at stake...
