## **The Use of Knowledge in Society**     
by Hayek F.A. (1945)         
*The American Economic Review* 35: 519–530

#### Hayek's contribution is identifying the mechanism of the market system
Briefly, we sketch the essence of a market organization. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

(...) only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information. — [The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1974.](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/press-release/)

#### Decentralization is the most efficient organization to react quickly to changes 
According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand. Planning how everyone should react from a central point is nearly impossible, because it would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge that are dispersed among all people to come up with the best plan. In practice, this would be slow and always imperfect so that there always be several plans to suggest. For this reason and others — that are detailed in his book *The Road to Serfdom* —, the organization should build on knowledge *decentralization*.
#### Prices evolution act as instructions for self-interested actors
How, then, can people know how to correctly adapt to change? In fact, they only need to know if they should increase or decrease their _relative_ consumption or production of goods and commodities. Therefore, as long as people act to maximize their own benefit, the _price mechanism_ channels information (reduced to digits) between individuals whose fields of vision sufficiently overlap, and gives _instructions_. If the price of this commodity increases, I reduce my consumption of it and buy more of similar but different one. The more flexible the prices are, the more efficient the mechanism is. In general, attempts to interfere with prices would hampered the market _self-regulation_.

#### The market mechanism as a wider range of applicability (social phenomena)
The decentralized plans of _self-interested actors_ — e.g. consumers and sellers aiming at maximizing their own benefit — constitute the _competition_ for Hayek. It therefore posseses an extensive aspect (e.g. more actors, sellers or consumers, increase the competition). Hayek concludes that humans have used the market system for a long time without understanding it. In fact, according to him, the mechanism he describes has something to do with nearly all social phenomena because (he reports a quote from Whitehead): “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”
