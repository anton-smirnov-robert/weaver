### Measurements of biological objects and biological knowledge

Generic objects are symmetric with respect to the scientific rationale, and one needs not to specify which electron it uses for an experiment in physics. In other words, electrons all share the same properties that define them. The object of biology, organisms, are specific objects. Therefore, biological knowledge is *a priori* bounded in time if one assumes that the relevance of an epistemic insight is primarily to be assessed by the existence of the studied object.

The merit of this provocative view is to contrast with the mainstream belief that looks for invariant laws in biology. Indeed, practical measures undertaken to tackle the irreproducibility crisis in biomedical research ([Bustin2014](reference/Bustin2014.md),[Baker2016](reference/Baker2016.md)) are rather protocolization ([Montevil2021](reference/Montevil2021.md)), making raw data available, or even video-taping scientists ([Clark2017](reference/Clark2017.md)), rather then questionning theoretical frames ([Soto2021](reference/Soto2021.md)).

A proper philosophical inquiry about the nature of biological knowledge seems crucial once organisms are acknowledged as specific objects. Can we obtain general insights of biological phenomena? Is studing extinct organisms relevant *per se* or does it need to aim at to understanding the history of the present ones? Does biological knowledge is less certain, by construction, than the one of physics? What does biology aims to understands if organisms are continuously changing their laws? Are there regularities in the ways variations are unpredictably occuring ? Does those regularities have a lifetime?

In any case, there is no doubt that practical research in biology must be able to generalize scientific results. Therefore, in practice, measurements need to go beyond the principled specificity of organisms, and argue for practical categories, a process called *symmetrization* ([Montevil2020a](reference/Montevil2020a.md)).
