[literature note on Hayek1945](note/literature%20note%20on%20Hayek1945.md)

We sketch the essence of a market organization ([Hayek1945](reference/Hayek1945.md)) which is a system of economic actors and goods. Essentially, it amounts to explaining the reason why the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has awarded Friedrich Hayek in 1974. According to the institute, his contribution has been to show that:

According to Hayek, the economic problem is about collectively and quickly _adapting to changes_ (e.g. shortage, technical breakdown, etc.) in order to make offer meet demand (T5). Planning how everyone should react from a central point would require centralizing all kinds of knowledge dispersed among actors to come up with the best plan on how to react. This would be slow, imperfect and several plans would be suggested (raising political conflicts). For this reason, the organization should keep knowledge decentralized. 

A finite set of economic actors are all inclined to consume or produce a various finite sets of goods. This parametrizes their field of visions which need to overlap one another (T1). The state of those actors is described by their variable consumption and production of goods. The state of the latter is their variable price (T2), but their flexibility is parametrized.

To reach the equilibrium of the global economy, local actors only need to differentiate their local consumption or production of goods. Hayek's main idea is that to know in what way to do it, they only need their personal knowledge — "which by its nature cannot (...) be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form" — and an additional shared information, a price, that couple them to the rest of the economy. Alone, or without prices, an economic actor does not receive any information and she does not change her production or consumption: her state is inertial (T3). When goods have prices that can be changed by producters, if (and only if) economic actors act to maximize their profit, the variation of prices become instructions that determine the actions of individuals and regulate the economy[^1] (T4). For instance, if the price of a commodity of one's interest increases, one reduces its consumption of it and buy more of similar but different one. 

For Hayek, competition is the decentralized plans of self-interested actors. For knowledge to be the most efficiently used, competition should be maximized and the flexibility of the prices be the largest not to hamper with the market self-regulation (T6). 

This very short analysis allows us to conclude that Hayek's market system is a [mechanistic organization](concept/mechanistic%20organization.md).
